    "The specific NLP task at hand is called \"semantic search\" under the field of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential features:\n",
    "- Personally, I wouldn't let people see the whole database cuz nothing good comes out of it\n",
    "- What'd be really cool (& attention capturing) is if we could do multiple searches at once. Split queries by `'\\n'` & return columns of distinct search results\n",
    "- Have maximum length be 100 characters. Encourages succinctness & for users to split separate problems into separate queries.\n",
    "- Have template start with \"My client needs ...\" followed by some examples. Encourages users to focus on the help they would like to receive, not the problem they have or how things will worsen should the problem remain unchecked.\n",
    "- Bold keywords from query if they are present in description\n",
    "- Autocomplete\n",
    "- Autocorrect\n",
    "- If website tracks IP address, for very similar queries within short timespan, return different results\n",
    "- Scold people for vague queries, e.g. \"The more specific you are with your search, the more likely a relevant scheme can be properly identified. Don't worry, we do NOT collect any identifiable information from users.\"\n",
    "- SchemesSG could eventually function as a gapfinder, identifying gaps in social support for common problems"

    "    - Strict version is more important; but since we're currently not too sure about the quality of labels, keep the lenient version for now.\n",
