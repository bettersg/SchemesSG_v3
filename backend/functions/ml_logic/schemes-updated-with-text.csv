within apsn chaoyang school. the transition programme also prepares graduands of apsn chaoyang school to eventually make the transition to the stage of their education in apsn tanglin school or apsn katong school. key features: warm-hearted and caring staff committed to providing holistic and quality education module-based curriculum to cater to different learning abilities of pupils promoting alternative thinking strategies (paths) programme for developing social and emotional competencies pervasive use of ict to support teaching and leaning in all domains strong partnership programmes with school and community partners daily 15-min physical workout to promote healthy lifestyle literacy lower-primary pupils learn english through modified stellar (strategies for english language learning and reading). pupils learn through various activities including shared reading of “big books” and the scaffolding of writing activities. to equip pupils with the foundation skills for reading, all lower-primary pupils are also taught phonics through the reading mastery programme. upper-primary pupils are taught english through the thematic approach. component skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing, are taught through themes meaningful to the pupils. reading is continued to be emphasised for the pupils via multi-sensory, multi-media activities approach. numeracy the overarching goal of the numeracy curriculum is to ensure that all pupils in chaoyang school achieve a good foundation in numeracy, and to better prepare our pupils for the future working environment by developing functional, job-related skills. the numeracy curriculum comprises 4 main components: counting and computation, budgeting, scheduling, and measurement. pupils are also taught data analysis and problem-solving skills. science apsn chaoyang school introduced science as a subject for the upper-primary pupils. the curriculum seeks to enable pupils to make sense of their world and to pique their curiosity. inquiry-based learning is adopted as a key teaching pedagogy in order to create a learning environment that will excite and encourage pupils to find out more about the world. the themes that are taught include: diversity, cycles, systems, interactions and energy. life skills life skills focuses on everyday skills that pupils need to be self-reliant: independent living skills such as basic self-care, social competencies, work behaviours, and social emotional learning. these skills are essential because they provide the basis for independent living, and facilitate the transition from school to life in the “real world”. aesthetics aesthetics is embedded into the school curriculum to improve self-expression, concentration and motor skills, and channel pupils’ energy into positive activities. it also helps to lay the foundation for the acquisition of literacy, numeracy and life skills in a lively and wholesome way. aesthetics is a critical part of any child’s education as the skills learnt and experiences gained while taking part in visual arts, drama, dance and music classes help to improve their abilities in different areas of their life. different music, drama and visual arts genres also help to expose pupils to cultures across the world and enable them to be more inclusive in the larger global community. co-curricular activities (ccas) apsn chaoyang school’s co-curricular activities programme is conducted once a week and it introduces pupils to activities beyond their daily classroom routines. these activities are clustered under 3 groups: sports, aesthetics, and social enterprise. conducted during curriculum time, the cca programme is offered to all pupils regardless of age or ability. support services & partnerships allied professionals the allied professional (ap) department at apsn chaoyang school is made up of occupational therapists, psychologists, social workers and speech and language therapists. besides providing individual intervention to identified pupils and families, the ap team collaborates closely with teachers to implement multi-disciplinary programmes that are infused into the school curriculum to facilitate holistic development of pupils. the ap department also conducts parent workshops to educate parents and equip them with skills to help their children cope with changing emotional and behavioural needs, social communication patterns and motor development. parent support group parents are important partners for the education of students with asd in apsn chaoyang school. the parent support group (psg) was set up for better collaboration between school and parents. the psg works closely with the school to provide authentic learning opportunities for all students. parents meet up regularly for outings, workshops and gatherings. partnerships apsn chaoyang school’s partnership framework encompasses meaningful collaborations between school and community

to get an abortion, the first thing you should do is go to your doctor (you can go to a general practitioner (gp) or gynecologist). 1. mandatory counselling mandatory pre-abortion counselling is required before the procedure for all patients seeking abortions. your doctor will direct you to the counselling service after your consultation. girls below 16 years of age need to be counselled at the health promotion board counselling centre (except for rape victims). mentally disabled patients require certification by a psychiatrist that continuation of the pregnancy will be harmful to the mother before medical procedures can be done. if you want an abortion and your doctor refuses on personal grounds, you have the right to seek a second opinion. note: before 17 april 2015, non-singaporean women, or women with three or more children, or women who have not passed the psle and have no secondary education were not obliged to undergo pre-abortion counselling, but new guidelines make counselling mandatory for all patients. 2. waiting period there is a mandatory waiting period of 48 hours after the counselling is conducted before the procedure can be done. 3. records patients choosing to terminate a pregnancy are required to sign a declaration of marital status, educational level, and number of living children. the ministry of health maintains a register of all treatments to terminate pregnancy that records the patient’s name, date of procedure, and method of termination. patients will normally undergo post abortion counselling after the procedure and may be required to return a week later to check for any complications. because of the risk of infection, some doctors may advise that you should not have sex for up to two weeks after your procedure. 4 types of abortion first trimester surgical abortion — (8 to 12 weeks) if the pregnancy is more than eight weeks gestation, the preferred method is a vacuum aspiration. in this procedure, forceps are inserted into the vagina. a local anesthetic is inserted into the cervix. the cervix is then carefully dilated. a thin tube is passed through the cervix and into the uterus. a tube is attached and used to suction the tissue out of the uterus. a curette is then used to ensure the complete removal of pregnancy tissues second trimester surgical abortion — (12 to 24 weeks) this process is more complicated and hospitalisation is usually required for a day or two. medicine is inserted into the vagina to induce natural expulsion of the pregnancy. after the foetus and placenta are aborted, the womb is cleared by vacuum aspiration as above. because the second procedure is much more complicated, it is much better for an early decision for abortion be made. abortion is not allowed if a pregnancy has progressed beyond 24 weeks. most doctors would not initiate abortion beyond 23 weeks, so an earlier decision is best. the only exception to this rule is a severe or lethal foetal abnormality. even in this case, special approval would have to be sought from the authorities before the procedure can be done. 5 how much does an abortion cost? an abortion can cost from $800 to $5,000, depending on whether the procedure is conducted in a restructured hospital (kk women’s and children’s hospital, singapore general hospital, or national university hospital), a private hospital, or a private clinic. singaporean patients can use their medisave accounts to subsidise the procedure. 6 resources for women under 21 pregnant women should seek medical assistance and not self-medicate or turn to folk remedies (e.g. eating pineapple) in order to terminate a pregnancy. babes offers a helpline, an online chat application, or an in-person meeting with information about various options available to prepare a pregnant woman under the age of 21 to make an informed decision. once she has made a decision, babes provides essential support and links to the appropriate resources. 7 risks of pregnancy and abortion abortion is one of the safest surgical procedures for women, if it takes place within the first trimester and is done by a trained professional. the risk of death associated with abortion is low and the risk of major complications is less than 1 percent. in fact, giving birth is more dangerous than an abortion. however, problems are more likely if an abortion is carried out later in a pregnancy. the medical risks associated with abortions are: haemorrhage (excessive bleeding) – occurs in about one in every 1,000 abortions damage to the cervix (the entrance of the womb) – occurs in no more than 10 in every 1,000 abortions damage to the womb – occurs in up to four in every 1,000 abortions during surgical abortion, and less than one in 1,000 medical abortions carried out at 12-24 weeks (source: national health service, uk) 8 abortion myths myth: “abortion is a very dangerous procedure.” fact: abortion is one of the safest surgical procedures for women, if it takes place within the first trimester and is done by a trained professional. the risk of death associated with abortion is low and the risk of major complications is less than 1 percent. in fact, giving birth is more dangerous than an abortion. myth: “women who have had abortions are traumatised.” fact: there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that having an abortion is any more dangerous to a woman’s long-term mental health than delivering and parenting a child she did not intend to have or placing a baby for adoption. studies demonstrate that the predominant feeling following abortion is one of relief and diminution of stress. some people do experience guilt and sadness after an abortion. these feelings are legitimate and there are people who can help. whoever provided your abortion should be able to direct you towards post-abortion counselling services. (source: motherjones) myth: “abortion causes breast cancer.” fact: early studies suggesting an increase in breast cancer among women who had abortions have been found to be flawed and widely discredited. newer, better-designed studies consistently showed no association between induced and spontaneous abortions and breast cancer risk. (source: national cancer institute) myth: “abortion causes infertility.” fact: having an abortion will not usually affect your chances of becoming pregnant and having normal pregnancies in future. (source: nhs, uk) 9 more information guidelines on termination of pregnancy (pdf) – ministry of health 10 statistics a ministry of health spokeswoman said there were 10,960 abortions in singapore in 2012, compared to 12,208 in 2011. during the same period there were 33,205 babies delivered, indicating that roughly 1 in 4 pregnancies are terminated. contact us privacy policy copyright © 2024 aware. all rights reserved."

to view it. introduction to e2c programme our programme clients coming into the e2c programme will go through a structured 5-stage process which enables us to assess their suitability. the programme builds on the clients’ strengths and interests and identifies learning needs to help us match them to a suitable job. with the training and support provided in our programme, we increase the potential for clients to be successfully employed. 1 pre-assessment the first step is to meet with an e2c case manager, who will share more about the e2c programme and answer any questions. this will help determine if the programme is suitable for you (the client) or your child/ward with autism. if it is found to be a good match, an appointment will be made for an in-depth assessment. both client and parent(s)/guardian(s) must be present for this meeting. 2 assessment our e2c case manager will guide the client through a series of assessments to determine each client’s unique strengths, interests and learning needs. these assessments are customised for each individual, and include direct 1:1 assessments, assessments in authentic worksites, and interest surveys. information will also be gathered from other parties who are close to the client, such as the family, schools, medical health professionals and past employers. this information will be treated as confidential and used strictly in the interests of the client. e2c takes into account both “hard skills” and “soft skills” in these assessments. “hard skills” refer to knowledge and techniques that are used on-the-job, like computer skills, or baking, or cleaning. “soft skills” are equally important, and refer to more personal skills like communication and interpersonal skills, grooming and dressing, focus, stamina and speed. our case manager will share some of his/her findings and recommendations in the post-assessment debrief. he/she will recommend the key hard and soft skills areas where training is needed, appropriate strategies to and structures to teach the client, as well as suitable training areas with the highest chances of success. the family will also receive a summary report. in the course of e2c’s assessment, we may seek more information about the client from parties such as family, schools, medical health professionals and past employers. 3 training the client will begin vocational training in areas that are best suited to his or her strengths, interests and needs. these areas will be identified beforehand, and mutually agreed upon, based on the outcomes of e2c’s assessment. e2c job coaches use autism-friendly strategies to train the client in both hard and soft skills. the length of the training depends on the progress of the client in the key skills identified. the client will proceed to job placement when he or she has reached the necessary levels of skills and independence. the training of individual clients may take between 10 – 40 weeks before they are recommended for job placement. however, the duration of training varies according to the individual’s level of skills and the need for support. 4 placement clients will be matched to jobs when they are ready for work. job coaches will be there to support and guide the client at every step of the employment process: from the application and interview stages, to the explanation of the company’s policies and the signing of the contract. e2c will also engage the client’s supervisors and colleagues on how to work together with the client. 5 support our e2c job coaches will provide on-site support at the client’s workplace. their role is to coach the client in meeting the expectations of the job, and to act as an advocate and intermediary between the client and his or her colleagues. the level of support provided by the job coach will vary depending on the client’s needs. e2c is committed to providing the client with the long-term support that he or she needs to maintain employment. for prospective employers our clients' testimonials sign up for e2c programme the purpose of the client request form is to allow us to have a better understanding about the client’s situation and assess his/her suitability in obtaining employability & employment centre (e2c) services. however, the submission of this form does not constitute an admission to e2c services. admission to e2c services will be subjected to the outcome of the pre-assessment. client request form the eligibility criteria of the client are as follows: singapore citizen or singapore permanent resident aged 16 and above has a primary diagnosis of autism is not currently enrolled in another sped school / programme for employers people with autism have their own niches and preferences for certain types of jobs, which can be matched to employment opportunities. some of the most common jobs are cleaning, f&b, stocking, and office work. however, there are other jobs that people with autism can perform. many people with autism also have special talents in areas such as art, music, computing, and maths. with training and support, employers of people with autism can: gain employees who are focused on getting the job done according to the standards stated by your company. gain employees who enjoy and do well in aspects of the job that others consider “repetitive” or “boring”. gain employees who are loyal to the company, as people with autism are more likely to stay on a job once they are comfortable and know what to expect from the work and social environment. what kind of work can people with autism do? routine tasks (both basic or complex) tasks where attention to detail and accuracy is required (e.g. research work, data entry, word processing) tasks where there is a clear procedure to follow (e.g. sorting incoming and outgoing mails, filing, archiving, library work, baking, or packing) highly structured tasks with a right and a wrong way of doing something (e.g. software testing, data entry) tasks involving numbers and facts (e.g. maintaining accounting ledgers, cataloguing) what does e2c do to help potential employers? we assign well-qualified job coaches to assist your employee at no cost to employer. our coaches will: learn the job duties herself/himself and assist in teaching them to the employee. ensure that your job requirements are met (quality, quantity, safety, time limits, etc.) teach your employee the rules and policies. support employee in gaining social acceptance among his/her coworkers. as needed, educate managers and coworkers about autism. as needed, act as mediator for you, coworkers, the employee, and their families. phase out as your employee gains independence over time. what are the benefits and opportunities for potential employers? have a reliable workforce (especially when the work is routine) be a model of social inclusion have job training and support provided by e2c at no extra cost to the employer qualify for the special employment credit

client testimonials after a successful job matching, our clients are often kind enough to share some feedback on our working relationship. here are a few appreciated remarks. my case managers and coaches are patient with me and they are able to understand what i want to express. they show me how to carry out my tasks without being too harsh or critical. i enjoyed coming to work because it feels like a new phase of my life has begun, and i have this strong urge to learn as much as possible. marcus has been working at starbucks as a barista. i do not need to rely on my parents for pocket money as i have an income now. andrew tham as been working at mohh. at the workplace, my co-workers/supervisors help support me by helping me when i am not sure. for this year, i have set the goal of trying to do more credit card scanning, try different set of account type with high productivity. wei qun has been working at uob. i am able to understand after my coaches have briefed me with necessary information about my work. it will be simple for me to understand properly when i have many visual instructions in the file as reference, especially the notes which i have written down with my coach. chris has been working at uob. my coach helps provide step-by-step visuals for me. she also practises with me during training with clear instructions. at starbucks, the co-workers and supervisor correct and remind me of my negative behaviour. i feel that it is helpful to me. li rui has been working at starbucks. being able to come to work allows me a sense of “normality” and financial independence. it is meaningful as by helping the teachers with the job of educating special needs students in science. they deserve to be science literate just like the rest of us. sin wei has been working at pathlight school as a science lab assistant. i buy food and drinks with my salary. i save the extra remaining money. i do not need to take money from my parents anymore because i am earning my own money. christopher has been working as a pathlight school cleaning crew. at the workplace, my supervisors and co-workers have birthday celebrations and special occasions that we celebrate together, eat good food and also to interact with one another. every year we have celebration at christmas and that time during christmas, i became santa claus ... and there were lots of presents and food. zen has been working at uob. the e2c coaches are friendly and support me by showing me the steps. they practise with me and guide me to follow visuals. i feel motivated to come to

case manager not only helped identify specific job options, but also negotiated terms on my behalf, helped spread autism awareness to my workplace supervisors, and gave helpful advice about sundry job-related issues. kuan min has been working at mohh. our team ""different but not less."" quote by temple grandin yeok lin seek to understand. jelita i don't have a dis-ability, i have a different-ability... it means i may have to take a slightly different path than you."" quote by robert m. hensel ean everyone has his/her own potential. given the right guidance, people with autism can also soar high. joycelyn autism is like a rainbow. clarice ""what would happen if the autism gene was eliminated from the gene pool? you would have a bunch of people standing around in a cave, chatting and socializing and not getting anything done."" quote by temple grandin wei yang remember the time when somebody gave you a life-changing chance? these guys with autism need that too. if we don't give them these opportunities, who will? anhong every asd individual is asperlutely autsome in their own unique way! green ""do not judge me because i am different to you, i do not judge you for being different to me."" quote by tina j. richardson lizhen while we try to teach our children all about life, our children teach us what life is all about. micky ""if they can't learn the way we teach, we teach the way they learn."" quote by o. ivar lovaas joyce if given the opportunity for people with autism to spread their wings, they too, can take flight with the sky as their limit. sheena every person with autism can contribute. ike life is not just about what you are doing for others. but what others are doing for you. being able to see, how a client with autism has progressed from learning the skills you have been teaching, then to being hired in a job to do those skills, is something you don’t ever want to miss. the differences you have made, can be multiplied by so much, when you experience this yourself. kay walking with the special ones. adrian mahatma ghandi: ""strength does not come from physical capacity. it comes from an indomitable will."" dorothy last modified on

genetic markers.once a potential donor with similar genetic markers or human leukocyte antigen (hla) as the patient is identified in the database, a vt is initiated to confirm the typing of the donor’s hla. this is to ensure that this donor is indeed the best match. at this stage, a patient’s doctor may also request for vt to be performed on more than one donor to select the best option for the patient.the typical cost of a vt is less than $4,600 and has since covered new patients.this subsidy is now extended to:relapsed patients who have received a matched unrelated donor transplant in the past 5 years.patients in class b2 and c may be eligible for up to 2 additional vt subsidy.please refer to the table here for an overview of the revised vt subsidy.hpc procurement subsidy schemethe hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) procurement subsidy was introduced in 2019 to support the costs involved in procuring bone marrow or blood stem cells (also known as the hpc product). such costs vary depending on the country of origin of the donor to cover donor medical fees and logistics. it can go up to $75,000 if the hpc product is procured from overseas.the hpc procurement subsidy scheme comprises of three tiers:tier 1 (t1): hpc procurement subsidy – a one lump sum subsidy to offset the hpc procurement cost.tier 2 (t2): additional hpc procurement subsidy – in addition to t1 subsidy, patients may be eligible to apply for t2 subsidy, which subsidises up to 65% of the total hpc product cost. the t2 subsidy quantum is in accordance to the patients’ ward class, i.e. the same basis that governs patient subsidies in public hospitals in singapore.tier 3 (t3): supplementary hpc procurement subsidy – this option is for patients staying in subsidised wards (b2 and below) and can cover up to 100% of hpc product cost, subject to recommendation put forth by an accredited medical social worker (msw) and the bmdp’s approval. this subsidy is now extended to the following groups:relapsed patientspatients who require a donor lymphocyte infusion (dli)non-citizen children of singaporean/prsingaporean/pr patients who require a haploidentical/related donor transplant2 with no matched unrelated donor availableplease refer to the table here for an overview of the revised hpc procurement subsidy scheme.patient subsidy fundthe patient subsidy fund supports costs associated with matched unrelated donor transplants as well as post-transplant expenses for patients. it hopes to alleviate patient’s treatment costs and support them through post-transplant expenditures.it takes the form of:a. transplant-related cost subsidypatients who are singaporeans or permanent residents, holding the chas card (orange or blue) or under a medifund case, may be funded for their transplant-related cost (e.g. ward charges, transplant procedures, medications etc) at public hospitals. the subsidy will cover up to 50% of the total cost, subject to a cap of sgd 50,000 per patient.b. post-transplant allowancespatients who are singaporeans or permanent residents, holding the chas card (orange or blue) or under a medifund case, may be given sgd 500 per month allowance for up to 12 months from the date of their transplant to support their post-transplant expenditures. the provision of allowance is introduced in view of the patients’ long recovery process and medical follow-ups following their transplant. for the first few months, patients may be required to have up to three follow-up appointments per week with the medical team to monitor the patient’s condition. on average, the journey to recovery before a patient can integrate back into the workforce may take up to 12 months. the allowance will cease when the patient commences employment or if the patient passes on.this subsidy is now extended to relapsed patients who have received a matched unrelated donor transplant in the past 5 years. patients who have previously utilised the patient subsidy fund

patient subsidies home patients & families patient subsidy schemes verification typing subsidythe verification typing (vt) subsidy was introduced in 2016 to offset the costs needed to carry out a second typing of an identified donor’s genetic markers.once a potential donor with similar genetic markers or human leukocyte antigen (hla) as the patient is identified in the database, a vt is initiated to confirm the typing of the donor’s hla. this is to ensure that this donor is indeed the best match. at this stage, a patient’s doctor may also request for vt to be performed on more than one donor to select the best option for the patient.the typical cost of a vt is less than $4,600 and has since covered new patients.this subsidy is now extended to:relapsed patients who have received a matched unrelated donor transplant in the past 5 years.patients in class b2 and c may be eligible for up to 2 additional vt subsidy.please refer to the table here for an overview of the revised vt subsidy.hpc procurement subsidy schemethe hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) procurement subsidy was introduced in 2019 to support the costs involved in procuring bone marrow or blood stem cells (also known as the hpc product). such costs vary depending on the country of origin of the donor to cover donor medical fees and logistics. it can go up to $75,000 if the hpc product is procured from overseas.the hpc procurement subsidy scheme comprises of three tiers:tier 1 (t1): hpc procurement subsidy – a one lump sum subsidy to offset the hpc procurement cost.tier 2 (t2): additional hpc procurement subsidy – in addition to t1 subsidy, patients may be eligible to apply for t2 subsidy, which subsidises up to 65% of the total hpc product cost. the t2 subsidy quantum is in accordance to the patients’ ward class, i.e. the same basis that governs patient subsidies in public hospitals in singapore.tier 3 (t3): supplementary hpc procurement subsidy – this option is for patients staying in subsidised wards (b2 and below) and can cover up to 100% of hpc product cost, subject to recommendation put forth by an accredited medical social worker (msw) and the bmdp’s approval. this subsidy is now extended to the following groups:relapsed patientspatients who require a donor lymphocyte infusion (dli)non-citizen children of singaporean/prsingaporean/pr patients who require a haploidentical/related donor transplant2 with no matched unrelated donor availableplease refer to the table here for an overview of the revised hpc procurement subsidy scheme.patient subsidy fundthe patient subsidy fund supports costs associated with matched unrelated donor transplants as well as post-transplant expenses for patients. it hopes to alleviate patient’s treatment costs and support them through post-transplant expenditures.it takes the form of:a. transplant-related cost subsidypatients who are singaporeans or permanent residents, holding the chas card (orange or blue) or under a medifund case, may be funded for their transplant-related cost (e.g. ward charges, transplant procedures, medications etc) at public hospitals. the subsidy will cover up to 50% of the total cost, subject to a cap of sgd 50,000 per patient.b. post-transplant allowancespatients who are singaporeans or permanent residents, holding the chas card (orange or blue) or under a medifund case, may be given sgd 500 per month allowance for up to 12 months from the date of their transplant to support their post-transplant expenditures. the provision of allowance is introduced in view of the patients’ long recovery process and medical follow-ups following their transplant. for the first few months, patients may be required to have up to three follow-up appointments per week with the medical team to monitor the patient’s condition. on average, the journey to recovery before a patient can integrate back into the workforce may take up to 12 months. the allowance will cease when the patient commences employment or if the patient passes on.this subsidy is now extended to relapsed patients who have received a matched unrelated donor transplant in the past 5 years. patients who have previously utilised the patient subsidy fund will also be eligible for this funding. it is not applicable for patients who received haploidentical/related donor transplant.please refer to the table

our missions / charity / medical assistance share medical assistance many a times, poverty is intertwined with illness and disability. some people became poor after contracting a major disease or becoming disabled due to an accident. such irreversible physical condition usually cost the unfortunate their career and thus the loss of financial stability. hence, medical assistance is part of the schemes under tzu chi mission of charity to serve the needy community better. besides providing subsidies for medical expenses, the provision of medical supplies is also a major feature of our medical assistance programme. for long-term users who are struggling with their own limited financials, when the annual costs of their medical supplies constantly outstrip the limits of government grants and allowances, tzu chi will step in to fill the gap.volunteers sort medical supplies, such as adult diapers, waste bags, nutritional milk, etc. according to type, size, quantity, and home address, before personally delivering them to individual households during the monthly home visits. the types of medical assistance provided by tzu chi are as follows: medical consumables interim dialysis fees medical transport fees day care fees &nbsp hiv medication fees antenatal check fees medical consumables interim dialysis fees medical transport fees day care fees &nbsp hiv medication fees antenatal check fees apply for assistancerenal support programmeoffering timely assistance to relieve sufferingaccording to official reports, there are an average of six new cases of kidney disease each day in singapore. some of these renal patients have to rely on dialysis for survival before a transplant is possible.in 2005, tzu chi volunteers discovered that some renal patients had to wait two to three months for the disbursement of funds after applying for subsidies for dialysis from other organisations, and fell into financial hardships as they were unable to afford the expensive treatments. furthermore, a number of tzu chi care recipients were also suffering from renal disease. thus, tzu chi partnered with hospitals and non-profit dialysis centres to launch the dialysis assistance programme in april to assist needy renal patients regardless of race and religion and is available to both singapore citizens and permanent residents. patients may apply for the assistance through medical social workers, and a tzu chi home visit team will assess each case.tzu chi also provides transport allowances for patients with mobility problems who are unable to afford the transport costs of travelling between their home and the dialysis centre.home visit teams will make care visits to beneficiary patients once a month, to monitor their health conditions as well as to give them moral support. patients who are in need of further financial aid will be referred to the foundation. given the increasing demand for assistance and support in this area, we are getting our staff and volunteers trained and enhancing our services to cater to more renal patients with different needs. currently, we are accompanying our renal care recipients with the following programmes:dialysis assistance programmethe assistance programme caters to dialysis patients with different needs over two schemes. the first scheme is the interim dialysis assistance scheme, which provides 3 months of interim funding for patients undergoing dialysis at private dialysis centres while waiting for long-term subsidised placement. the period of subsidy has been extended to up to 6 months since 2022 due to a supply shortage of affordable dialysis treatment services. the second scheme is the dialysis transport assistance scheme, which pays for the costs of travelling between home and the dialysis centre by taxi, wheelchair-friendly transport or ambulance for frail patients with mobility problems. about $8.6 million worth of funding has been granted as of mar 2023, benefitting more than 3,800 dialysis patients. the same programme also includes non-financial support in the form of home visits to monitor and provide moral support to these care recipients. renal support programmethis group programme provides psychosocial support to renal patients through companionship by volunteers, occasional gatherings at tzu chi premises and a telegram channel which periodically delivers helpful information to renal patients.renal conservative (non-dialysis) care programmethis is a joint programme between tzu chi and sengkang general hospital, which aims to optimise the medical care for elderly kidney failure patients age 60 and above to slow down renal disease progression, manage complications, and control symptoms through a holistic approach to maintain their quality of life. kidney failure patients are assessed and referred by sengkang general hospital, and the community nurses will provide regular home visits.renal dialysis centre (coming soon)tzu chi will be operating a dialysis centre in buangkok. it will be the first dialysis centre operated by tzu chi and will help to meet the increasing demand for dialysis services in the northeastern zone of singapore. stories of love and compassion benefitting a family by helping one person 43 years old imran was diagnosed with kidney failure caused by diabetes in october 2020. after being diagnosed with kidney disease, he started developing other health problems including stage 3 depression, anxiety, panic attack, mild stroke, thyroid cancer, and a cardiovascular issue that could lead to sudden death. as the sole breadwinner of the family of four, the news came as a shock for him. imran used to be an active person who likes to do a variety of sports and sweat under the sun. it took him 3 months to finally accept the fact that he has to undergo dialysis and that life will never be the same again. the monetary aid from tzu chi’s interim dialysis assistance scheme helped cover the hefty dialysis cost while imran waited for the long-term subsidised placement from nkf. helping eskd elderly live the life they want in their remaining years 85 years old mr oh was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure in 2021. instead of opting for haemodialysis, mr oh chose to receive renal conservative (non-dialysis) care (“rcc”). after deciding on conservative non-dialysis treatment and being enrolled on the rcc programme, mr oh can work six days a week without feeling tired. he was glad that he need not spend the rest of his life going to the hospital or the dialysis centre frequently. despite already reaching the golden age in life, mr oh has been able to work take care of his wife after returning home from work. be a volunteer donate related news fulfilling a lunar new year invitation as a tzu

living assistance tzu chi provides direct, timely and practical assistance to give the kind of help needed by each individual and household. besides providing financial support to help cover some living expenses, tzu chi also provides essential daily items such as formula milk, diaper and food in an ongoing manner. our volunteers also help to declutter and furnish the homes of some care recipients who are unable to clean up their homes by themselves and deliver meals to care recipients who have difficulty cooking or leaving their homes to buy food. since 1991, living aid distribution has been ongoing until this day and is a much-anticipated activity for many of our beneficiaries and volunteers. during major living aid distribution events, hot meals are served to participants to warm their bodies and hearts.starting in 2017, the foundation began holding the aid distribution event three times a year during the festive celebrations of chinese new year, hari raya puasa, and deepavali. care recipients belonging to each racial group are invited to jing si hall to join in the respective festive celebrations. on each occasion, the volunteers spare no effort in decorating the venue, meticulously arranging the food, and preparing engaging programmes just to ensure that the guests feel the comforting warmth of a home away from home. the types of living assistance provided by tzu chi are as follows： household living expenses furnish & retrofit support home decluttering meals delivery apply for assistancestories of love and compassion home cleaning before hdb home upgrading starts home decluttering service is not a fixed service provided by tzu chi. however, it is still rendered when it is necessary. in 2019, the home of an elderly tzu chi care recipient, grandma lee, was scheduled to undergo an upgrade under the hdb upgrading programme. however, cleaning and tidying work before and after the home upgrading programme was a major hassle for the elderly. in 2014, grandma lee had a fall, rupturing her pelvic bones in the process. after having surgery, she experienced serious degeneration in her knees, which limited her mobility. her husband has also been unable to exert power and lift heavy objects because he has been a stroke patient for many years. on the day of deepavali, a group of seven volunteers gathered at grandma lee’s home in hougang in the afternoon, to carry out the tidying-up and cleaning work to get her house ready for the upgrading work. the three xu siblings xu fu de, an elderly renal patient, began receiving care visits from tzu chi volunteers in 2007 due to his ongoing need for dialysis. with the help of volunteers, he managed to receive a higher level of government assistance subsequently. his dialysis treatments were fully covered by the national kidney foundation (nkf) while tzu chi paid for the transportation costs of his appointments. he shared an apartment with two divorced siblings. the family's pillar of support was xu fu chen, his older brother, who was close to 80 years old. he would buy breakfast for his younger siblings and accompany them for their medical appointments. after xu fu chen passed away in 2013, tzu chi volunteers started playing the role of the oldest sibling in the family, taking turns to deliver three daily meals to their home, and seeing to the daily needs of the two other elderly siblings. later, the foundation partnered with other social service organisations to provide the necessary care for them. in june 2014, xu fu de passed on due to a lung infection, and volunteers helped to make arrangements for his funeral. concerned about the younger sister (remaining sibling) xu wen di’s daily living needs, volunteers living nearby visited her frequently to give her care and support, until they found a suitable nursing home that admitted her. a care recipient who volunteers took eight years to meet for the first time 2011 was a year of heavy responsibilities weighing down on mr wong. his business investment had failed while his wife, who worked as a government grassroots worker, suffered severe depression and eventually had to quit her job. mrs wong shut herself off from the world and refused to socialise for eight years, even when home visit volunteers came to help. however, the volunteers persisted and communicated with mrs wong via email, providing her with guidance and encouragement. since becoming a care recipient household under tzu chi, the foundation has provided the family with a monthly subsidy and educational support for their children. the volunteers had visited them 120 times over the past ten years. the visits helped mr and mrs wong get out of their mental predicament. in august 2021, mr wong returned to work at a fast-food restaurant, and both of his children graduated and entered the workforce. mr and mrs wong requested that tzu chi discontinue their subsidies when their current income was sufficient to sustain their lifestyle. mr wong would pass his excess daily allowance to mrs wong, who would put it into a bamboo coin bank, and they would donate it when the volunteers visited each month. they are grateful for tzu chi's company over the years and hoped that volunteers would continue to visit them. be a volunteer donate related news fulfilling a lunar new year invitation as a tzu chi care recipient for a

home / our missions / charity / mission of charity share mission of charity responding to the cries of the suffering with great love tzu chi volunteers address the needy households they assist as ‘households of gratitude’. this is not about wanting the care recipients to thank tzu chi for its help, but rather the volunteers are grateful to the needy for allowing them to witness poverty and illness in life. it helps to remind them that impermanence is a reality in life, and thus, they learn to be content and count their blessings. in the process of giving, it is equally important to thank the care recipient, only then are we truly sincere in caring for the suffering.” master cheng yen providing direct aid to those in needcharity is the foundation of tzu chi’s missions. in 1966, the year after taiwan experienced 20 years of poverty and received 15 years of us aid after the second world war, dharma master shih cheng yen founded tzu chi from scratch in hualien, a town located in the impoverished and remote east coast of taiwan. together with her monastic disciples and a group of housewives, she laid the groundwork for helping the poor and relieving suffering.in the early days, master cheng yen personally led tzu chi volunteers into the dark corners of society. during the course of visiting the homes of the impoverished, they witnessed the suffering and hardships of the sick and the poor and provided them with empathetic care and much-needed aid. being the first to reach out to the needy and committed to helping them until the end, tzu chi volunteers accompany and care for the care recipients until they become independent or until the end of their life. such spirit of compassionate great love has become the hallmark of tzu chi’s mission of charity. when tzu chi reached the shore of singapore, it was registered as tzu-chi foundation (singapore). the foundation has since developed and established a number of charitable programmes in multi-racial singapore to address the most pressing societal needs. these programmes serve to fill in the gaps where existing government resources may be lacking and meet the needs of those who are marginalised in society, regardless of their race, language or religion.since 1987, tzu chi has been providing emergency assistance and long-term aid to needy households. during which, our volunteers have been making regular visits to nursing homes to give care and emotional support to the sick and lonely elderly. in addition, the foundation also forged partnerships with public institutions, such as schools, hospitals, and social service agencies to serve the needs of referral cases.the changing times have brought about new challenges to tzu chi’s charity work, spurring the need for the foundation to keep a close pulse on evolving societal needs and to recognise hidden needs in the dark recesses of society. in 1998, we were the very few social service agencies that provided subsidies for aids medications and mobilised our volunteers to visit them regularly to offer emotional care and support. the subsidy for aids medication continued until january 2021 when it ceased due to the dwindling of such demand. from 1998 to 2021, the programme benefitted 1739 aids patients. the effects of the global financial crisis landed on singapore's shores in 2008, pushing many families over the edge into dire financial straits. in the following year, tzu chi set up the seeds of hope financial assistance scheme to provide meal and transportation allowances to students from low-income families. over the years, the assistance scheme has evolved to meet the changing demands of families with school-going children.upholding its relief principles of timeliness, directness, priority, and respect, the various types of help are offered in accordance with the specific needs of each household and can be categorised into living assistance, medical assistance and educational assistance. in the past, we only focused on inspiring the rich to help the poor, by calling on those who are financially able to help the impoverished. now, we also work to guide the poor to do good, by sharing with them that in the process of receiving aid, they can also contribute their efforts to help others in need if they wish to. thus, a continual cycle of kindness and charity is formed.” master cheng yen inspiring the rich to help the poor and guiding the poor to do good in returnthe works of tzu chi’s mission of charity involve ongoing needs assessment, providing the required assistance, and ensuring long-term care for its care recipients. it is a rigorous process comprising an initial visit to assess the needs of the potential care recipient, a follow-up meeting to discuss each new case, and monthly care visits to the homes of confirmed care recipients by our volunteers.besides making regular home visits, our volunteers also organise festive celebrations and invite care recipients and their family members to participate in the events. by providing care from the heart, we hope to improve the quality of life of our care recipients and help them get their lives back on track.our home visit volunteers, who are spread island-wide in every neighbourhood, are committed to master cheng yen’s ideal of “equal compassion for all”. they prepare meals and distribute aid supplies to households and individuals in need, and help with cleaning up, repairing, and renovating homes, allowing the latter to feel the love and warmth of family. touched by their loving and sincere efforts, many care recipients gradually opened up their hearts and built trusting relationships with the volunteers. under the inspired guidance of the home visit teams, many of our care recipients have come to realise that true wealth comes from giving, and are happy to pay it forward to help others in need. stories of love and compassion sending love and warmth amid covid-19 since the first singapore covid-19 case in january 2020, the situation rapidly escalated into a major lockdown in april, leading to an extended period of pandemic conditions. to address the crisis, tzu chi established a special task force that implemented a crisis management plan and epidemic relief programme to enhance safety measures across various establishments and provide relief support to migrant workers, front liners, and over 700 care recipients. the programme was executed in three phases to ensure the timely distribution of relief supplies and assistance. given social distancing measures, weekly phone calls were made to monitor the well-being of more than 100 critically vulnerable households. additionally, a survey was conducted to assess the needs of 550 care recipient households, enabling tailored support to be provided. while most people could stay home to avoid infection, front liners were burdened with excessive workloads to keep essential services available to the public. empathizing with the frontline workers, tzu chi volunteers went to community isolation facilities to distribute care packs to front liners as a token of gratitude. in 2020 and 2021, many of our volunteers were on the daily roster in 3 different community isolation facilities over 553 volunteer shifts to support the frontline workers by chatting with them and serving them tea and snacks. safeguarding the mental wellbeing of migrant workers when covid-19 started spreading in migrant workers dormitories, approximately 300,000 migrant workers were confined to their dormitories and had their movement restricted for a prolonged period to prevent a widespread of the virus in the community. aware of the potential adverse outcome of such a measure, the ministry of manpower (mom) was highly concerned about the mental well-being of the group. in june and july 2021, tzu chi worked with the mom to organise a series of online activities, which comprised mental health talks, pilates lessons, and poetry appreciation sessions, hoping to bring some relief to the dormitory residents. when the pandemic restrictions were lifted, together with mom and five other non-governmental organisations (ngos), tzu chi jointly organised on-site carnivalesque events at kranji recreation centre and terusan recreation centre to bring joy and warmth to dormitory residents. a care recipient who quit smoking and drinking to donate to charity tzu chi care recipient tan yew hock was a heavy smoker and an alcoholic who suffered from high cholesterol, diabetes, depression and colon cancer for over 10 years. due to such a health condition, tan had to take 50 pills every day. tan was also a bad-tempered man, which contributed to the breakdown of his family. he even spent some time living on the streets. upset with himself and with life, tan attempted suicide for three times in the hospital as he was overwhelmed by the stress. thankfully, tzu chi volunteers entered his life and started visiting him at his home. in the beginning, tan appeared worried and gloomy during each visit and he spoke very little. tan received some help and support from the volunteers but couldn’t quit his smoking and drinking habits at the beginning. the volunteers then shared with him jing si aphorisms and gave him a bamboo coin bank. after some time, tan began filling up the bamboo coin bank with savings each month, despite having insufficient money for himself. after three years of continuous care and companionship, tan finally quit his bad habits and changed his temper. charity schemes treating the needy and suffering as family and reaching out to them with compassioncompassion and wisdom in actiontzu chi’s long-term mode of assistance has evolved with the advancement of society to become more diversified, allowing for flexibility in rendering help while ensuring effectiveness. it comprises assistance for living expenses, medical assistance, education grants, regular care visits, etc. the various types of assistance are provided in accordance with each household’s unique needs, which are determined based on quarterly needs assessments and monthly visits conducted by volunteers. this ensures a deep understanding of the needs of each care recipient, and the amount of aid given will be adjusted to meet these needs or terminated if the needs have been met by other sources.spiritual counselling and emotional care are the focus of the home visits. each home visit team strives to follow master cheng yen’s teaching on the importance of exercising both compassion and wisdom. the home visits are conducted by volunteers who have received the required basic training. with enthusiasm to help those in need, they provide emotional care as well as patient guidance to care recipients.some of the care beneficiaries are impoverished and sick, living a life of hardship and despair, alienated from friends and kin alike. through the persistent effort of the home visit teams to establish rapport with them, they are finally able to let down their guards and allow the volunteers to clean up their cluttered homes, bathe them, give them haircuts, and even help them seek medical help, etc. inspired and touched by the volunteers’ loving efforts, many care recipients are able to settle down despite their humble circumstances, develop gratitude and contentment, and further give of themselves to help others in need. tzu chi’s aid relief can be categorised into living assistance, medical assistance and educational assistance and each of them is divided into primary and secondary assistance schemes.the primary assistance scheme is set up to meet basic needs and relieve poverty, and it is open to the public. whereas the secondary assistance scheme is only available for tzu chi’s existing care recipients to provide more holistic care and support to meet the diverse needs of different households. the aim of the scheme is to improve the overall quality of life of the care recipients and their family. application is made through home visit volunteers who visit the care recipients monthly.primary assistance schemes: meet basic needs relieve poverty open to the public secondary assistance schemes: provide holistic care to meet the diverse needs of each household improve living quality and assist care recipients to regain independence open to existing care recipients only living assistance medical assistance educational assistance each act of goodness translates to a blessing and reduces suffering in the world. jing si aphorism by master cheng yen stay informed about our work sign up

the highest number of sessions with my therapist. she didn't give up on me. it was a journey that has helped me improve and start performing daily activities, like going out or even just going to the bathroom. i would use the methods and skills that my therapist has taught me to do whenever i am in an unsafe or uncomfortable situation. i would definitely recommend my therapist at clarity singapore to my friends and family. lynn, 21i am deeply grateful for having met my therapist at clarity singapore in this lifetime — i often think if it was not for her, i wouldn’t be here today. the sessions with her and having her support have contributed greatly to my self-growth and -development, knowing that there's someone who has my back, believes in me and never judges my thoughts, actions and feelings. once again, i thank my therapist. i want her to know that she has made a difference in my life and that her positivity will always inspire me to do better, knowing that i can be better. suzanne*, 28my therapist was kind, understanding and professional. i am grateful for having learned skills that have helped me cope with the various situations and mental states that i face, learn self-compassion, how to interact with others and manage my emotional state. it has not always been an easy journey, but i am thankful that i have been making progress – which is the most important thing!tom*, 27therapy with clarity singapore has helped me feel more confident about myself, being equipped with the mental toolkit. the complete honesty exercise from the mental toolkit has helped me during times when i feel overwhelmed. therapy has also helped me stop my negative automatic thoughts and manage the symptoms of schizophrenia. jane*, 26i have a sounding board, someone to talk to and who was able to help me re-assess my perspectives and identify my blind spots so that i can get rid of negative thought patterns. this is my second time at clarity singapore. i appreciate that it provides affordable mental health care because something as critical as mental health should be accessible to more people.mary*, 27i came to clarity singapore feeling extremely unstable, i didn’t know what i wanted or needed. i just felt sad and wanted to escape reality so bad. then i met my therapist and she has been so, so amazing in this journey. she was very patient with me throughout and was able to draw out a lot of strengths in me throughout the entire process. she taught me a lot of relaxation techniques to ground myself and made me realise a lot of things that i never thought i would realise. she helped me grow a lot personally and i’m eternally grateful to her.anna*, 24i came for therapy as i would get anxious very easily which caused or was caused by the negative mindsets, and this affected my ability to concentrate and do works (such as trembling), as well as my emotional feelings. after attending all the therapies, with the help of therapists, i find myself improving by leaps and bounds. besides, my mindset is becoming more positive as well, with all the techniques and encouragement i received from my therapist.andy*, 19previousnextenquiries

processes as new book on workplace learning featuring kwsh unveiled november 19, 2020 2020 0 enhancing work processes as new book on workplace learning featuring kwsh unveiled kwsh is honoured to have been featured in a new book published by the singapore institute of technology! titled the learning enterprise, the book features kwsh as one of the first four local organisations in workplace learning and lean transformation, and illustrates how our nursing team successfully improved the management of patients’ bathing process during the morning shift. this was achieved through the team’s application of lean tools, which cut down the bathing time of patients and allowed nurses to work on other value-added tasks. the new book was unveiled at the mou signing ceremony where kwsh was appointed as a skillsfuture queen bee on 13 november during the event where the book was unveiled, kwsh also showcased some of our key innovation milestones which have aided us greatly in raising productivity and the quality of care for our clients. one of these is the kronikare wound scanner, which can provide automated assessments of our clients’ chronic wounds. with this in place, we have implemented a new wound care system that can capture wound information for our digital management of the clients’ wound progress. more recently, we have tested and adopted the use of automated guided vehicles to deliver meals to our residents, freeing up our care staff to concentrate fully on tending to our residents in the wards. kwsh established as the first queen bee in singapore’s community

asked questions expand all | collapse all i was born after 31 december 1949 and became a citizen before end-1986. will i receive the pioneer generation package when i turn 65 this year?the pioneer generation package is not meant for all who turn 65 in 5, 10 or 25 years' time.rather, it is for the special generation of singaporeans who were at least aged 16 in 1965 - or are aged 65 and older by the end of 2014.initially, the government had considered providing the pioneer generation benefits to those who were at least aged 21 in 1965. however, we received feedback that many started working when they were 16 years old back in 1965. hence, the qualifying age was lowered.what should i do if i have misplaced my card and need a replacement?please call 1800-650-6060 for assistance.where can i receive my pioneer generation benefits?pioneers can receive special subsidies at polyclinics, subsidised specialist outpatient clinics (socs) in the public hospitals, and private general practitioner (gp) and dental clinics under the community health assist scheme (chas).please refer to section “what are the benefits?” for more details of the benefits.i would like to donate my pioneer generation - medisave top-ups. how can i do so?thank you for your kind spirit of generosity. we are glad that you are considering donating. however, we regret that you cannot donate your medisave top-ups because they are meant for your healthcare needs.instead, we encourage you to donate an equivalent cash sum (if you wish) to those in need. you may do so via online fundraising platforms such as giving.sg (by the national volunteer & philanthropy centre) or to community chest (by the national council of social service).i would like to appeal for the pioneer generation package. can i do so, and how?the appeals panel was set up in may 2014 and has carefully considered the criteria for assessing appeals.if you were born after 31 dec 1949, please note that no appeals will be received. as explained in response to queries in parliament and during the debate on the pioneer generation fund bill, the appeals panel recognised that the government had already adopted a more inclusive approach by extending the pioneer generation package to all those born in 1949 or earlier. whatever the age set, there will always be those who marginally fall short of it. it would therefore not be feasible or fair to allow age-related appeals without extending the new age criterion to all singaporeans. hence, as provided under the pioneer generation fund act, the panel decided that it would only consider appeals relating to the citizenship criterion.for citizenship-related appeals, the panel considers whether the person had obtained singapore citizenship shortly after 1986 – the year set as the citizenship cut-off date for eligibility of the pioneer generation package. in addition, it looks at factors such as whether he or she had been in singapore since the early years of independence, contributed to our society, and had demonstrated clear efforts to sink roots in singapore.if you marginally missed the citizenship date of 31 dec 1986 and you feel that you meet the criteria, please contact us at 1800-2222-888 or contactus@pioneers.gov.sg with your nric number to file an appeal. if you would like to appeal on behalf of a relative, please obtain your relative's consent first.i am a pioneer generation member and have an integrated shield plan, will i benefit from the medishield life subsidies?yes.integrated shield plans (ips), are made up of (i) medishield life and (ii) an enhanced portion providing better benefits and/or higher coverage (in private or class a/b1 wards in public hospitals). for those with ips, the special pioneer generation medishield life subsidies will apply to the medishield life component of their ip premium. videos did you know some of these benefits from the pioneer generation package? english please use this link to find out more. melayu please use

basic membership at the same time. if you have already completed your child’s birth registration, you can still proceed to the baby bonus website to apply for the baby bonus. 6. if my child has just

spouse is a singapore citizen at the time of your child's birth, he/she will be eligible for the full baby bonus benefits. your child must obtain singapore citizenship and join the scheme before reaching 12 years of age. if you and your spouse are not singapore citizens at the time of your child's birth, your child will be eligible for pro-rated benefits.your child must obtain singapore citizenship before 24 months of age to be eligible for the cash gift, and before 12 years of age to be eligible for the child development account. the pro-rated amount will depend on the date that he

are non-singapore citizen children/stepchildren/stillbirths counted in the birth order? the birth order is pegged to the number of singapore citizen children born to the mother or adopted by the mother. the computation of birth order includes biological children, adopted-in children, and stillbirths or children who have passed away. multiple births (e.g. twins and triplets) are considered separate birth orders. for example, the first twin is considered as the first child and the second twin as the second child.if there is an adopted child, the birth order is determined by the date of adoption, or the date the child becomes a singapore citizen, whichever is later. stepchildren, non-citizen children, foster children and adopted-out children are excluded from the computation of birth order. 9. are adopted children eligible for benefits under the baby bonus scheme? what are the benefits that an adopted child will receive? yes, adopted children are eligible if they meet the eligibility conditions. please use the eligibility check tool to check your adopted child’s eligibility and benefits. 10. is it compulsory to make a deposit to open a child development account and top up savings in the account to the specified cap once the account is opened? no, there is no such requirement. it is up to you to save based on your needs. for instance, if you save $10, the government will match with an additional $10. the savings may be used for your child’s educational and healthcare expenses at approved institutions registered with the ministry of social and family development until the end of the year that your child turns 12 years old. interest earned is not considered as a contribution and will not be matched. savings above the specified government contribution cap will also not be matched. you may save into your child’s child development account up to 31 december of the year he or she turns 12. 11. what can i use the savings in the child development account for?

year, i came to shan you with little or no expectation. i was convinced that the issues i was facing were self-inflicted and self-created. as such only i could pull myself out of it. no doubt i did not see the immediate benefits of our counselling sessions but gradually i saw that the compassion, empathy and non-judgemental “safe place” i experienced during my counselling sessions enabled me to find strength to unknowingly combat my suicidal tendencies as well as to begin to live with hope. i was able to learn techniques which i still apply in my life one year on. my counsellor, ga li helped me to “find meaning in the pain” and today i am in a place in my life i never thought possible 10 years ago.48-year-old femaledepression issuesi have seen many mental health professionals over the years to address certain difficult-to-treat issues: chronic depression, complex ptsd and various addiction problems. however none of them seems to produce much positive results and i even feel unsupported and not understood at times. when i came to shan you, i was initially doubtful about my counsellor wei xin as he is very young compared to the other counsellors i've worked with. but i found that we could connect on a very profound level compared to the other mental health professionals. he kept me going even as i lost hope that i could ever see the light at the end of the tunnel, and he was measured in his approach even as he was dynamic in addressing my evolving issues and needs. i also like the recent addition of therapeutic yoga exercises to our sessions too and i find it very empowering especially for a trauma patient like me. i couldn't recommend enough of shan you for its dedication to its clients.isaac (pseudoname)malemy counselling experience with ga li has been life-changing. in the 13 sessions, i've begun healing my childhood and relationship pains, gained so much awareness of the way i managed my thoughts and emotions, and i feel empowered to seek fulfillment, and practice much more self love and care. this has had a positive ripple effect to how people around me feel and behave with me too. i am forever grateful that i've found ga li - because through her, i found myself.31-year-old femalechildhood traumai started seeing a counsellor at shan you counselling centre in may 2017, with the hope to overcome the challenging moments in my life and prevent my condition from getting worse. this is the first time in my life. i tried to overcome the social stigma and my own perception to seek help at the counselling centre. i am so blessed to be paired with my counsellor who is very dedicated and understanding. she handled client consent in a professional manner, which made me confident to tell her my condition. my sleep pattern has improved after just a few sessions and slowly my mindset has changed. besides, i practise yin yoga and meditation too. i am so grateful to the professional counsellor and staff in shan you. thanks for never rejecting my first call and helping me get back on track. i think going for the counselling service here is one of the best choices that i have made.35-year-old female(counselling for depressive and anxiety symptoms)my experience for the counselling sessions has been very important to me. i do feel much better now and i have seen the improvement. the people around me also have mentioned that i have improved in various areas of my life. i think i am more well-equipped now to face these issues head-on. the roller coaster of my life is still going. but as we discussed, i am now taught to deal with it with a different approach as compared to the previous ways that damaged me in the past. thank you again ga li and shan you counselling centre for taking up my case.28-year-old maleanger management issuesgoing back 2 years ago, i was very intrigued by the mindfulness practice as i researched that it does help to elevate anxiety and create more self-awareness. shan you counselling was one of the few more affordable places that offered that and i was fortunate to be paired with my counsellor wei xin. he has created a safe space for me to learn about myself and to be able to verbalise my struggles. he isn't afraid to share his experiences too and ways he manages them. he also uses fun techniques such as cards with expression and alters the sessions based on your needs! i have grown to be a more aware individual both in my personal life and working life. on days that i am feeling anxious, i actively practice the suggestions that wei xin provides examples are breathing techniques and to expand my thoughts, it does help with creating more compassion for the ones around and most importantly myself. i am glad i had the support to take this step to grow as a person and always grateful for what wei xin has given to me as a person.sybil27-year-old femalei highly recommend shan you counselling center's counselling services. i have been under counsellor huang wei xin for the past 2 years and my time and money spent have definitely been well worth it. they have been very professional and provided more than adequate care for me. they provided a safe space to talk about my problems and mental health without feeling judged. counsellor wei xin was very patient and empathetic, and i always felt comfortable and heard whenever we were in session. i liked how each session helped to empower me and shed different perspectives on my situation. the coping mechanisms/tools gained have allowed me to better function and thrive in my day to day life. i would literally not be here without the persistent and consistent care given by my counsellor and shan you counselling center. very grateful to have found and employed their services.su lin28-year-old femalethe counselling service enabled me to listen better to my spouse. it helped me to realise my inability to discern things and to cope better. it also improved the relationship between me and my spouse. i will recommend this service to others.48-year-old male(counselling for marital concerns)at shan you, i've found a tranquil place and a safe, therapeutic space. from ping ping's patience and kindness at reception to my sessions with wei xin, my counsellor and even the ""homework"", each session has been very helpful in the face of mounting challenges & struggles. i am blessed to have been referred to shan you and assigned an experienced, empathetic cousellor to walk alongside me on my journey of healing and self-discovery.mei chu59-year-old femalei stopped blaming others and began seeing things the way they are. what i learnt about mindfulness here helped me better manage my emotions and interpersonal problems. i feel more confident as a person and have made many positive changes after counselling. thank you!23-year-old male(counselling for low self-esteem from body shame)during the first meeting, i didn't know what precisely was/were troubling me, just that i felt troubled and have been for as long as i can remember. with patience, empathy, genuineness, an open mind, and many thought-provoking questions, ga li helped me peel away at the layers and nudged me in the direction where i could and would find possible answers. maybe like most people who seek counselling, i did it as a last resort and with a head full of skepticism. but since my first session, not only have i changed my mind completely, it is now something i would point people who need help in the direction of.43-year-old femalecounselling for anger issues & self-criticismi just want to say a heartfelt thank you, ga li! i'm looking back at the year as it comes to a close, and it's unbelievable how absolutely challenging this year had been, and on so many fronts. i am fortunate to cross path with you at my most broken. thank you for giving me a safe space when i had nobody to speak to. it had, quite literally, saved me.35-year-old femalegrief & existential issues live. now. well.live. now. well. is an initiative by shan you counselling centre to provide accessible and effective mindfulness-based programmes to enhance mental and emotional wellness. these experiential programmes aim to help individuals cultivate mindfulness and empower them to make choices and take actions based on their personal values in daily life.join our programmes what is mindfulness?the practice of mindfulness helps us to direct attention to what is happening in the present moment with intention and openness to experience.cultivating mindfulness enables one to gain greater psychological flexibility to respond intentionally rather than reacting automatically to what is happening in the moment. the practice of mindfulness has been associated with improvements in physical, mental and emotional health as well as better quality of life. mindfulness-based cognitive therapymindfulness-based cognitive therapy (mbct) is an evidence-based 8-week programme that integrates mindfulness practices with elements of cognitive therapy.the programme helps participants to cultivate mindfulness and the capacity to be present to each moment with openness. mindfulness allows us the ability to respond intentionally and purposefully to situations in life instead of reacting habitually. research has shown that the mbct programme leads to improvements in one’s mental and emotional well-being and quality of life. mindful self-compassionmindful self-compassion (msc) is an empirically supported experiential programme that combines the skills of mindfulness and self-compassion to enhance one’s capacity for emotional wellness.self-compassion has the paradoxical effect of both soothing our emotional distress and opening us to the pain that we may have been unconsciously holding inside,often for many years. research has indicated that the msc programme significantly increases self-compassion, compassion for others, mindfulness and life satisfaction as well as decreases depression, anxiety and stress.what our past participants have to say…mindfulness with yoga has been enriching and eye-opening. it has enabled me to cultivate kindness to myself and appreciate the love around me. it has also allowed me to be a mindful parent as well. it was a good start to a long journey of mindfulness in future. my guru, jace, was patient, relevant and succinct with the information needed for understanding of yoga in simpler forms. thank you 😊abbyparticipant of mindfulness with yogabeing able to express ourselves using art is a less commonly used modality of expression in my daily life.

donation transportaid singapore red cross’ transportaid service helps older or disabled persons from lower-income homes get to and from their healthcare service facilities, such as medical treatments, rehabilitation and day activity centres. for many wheelchair users, getting to and from their medical appointments may be challenging, due to limited mobility and accessibility. for those struggling financially, the problem is exacerbated as commercially available private transport services are not economically feasible for the long term. with the transportaid service, those in need will be able to access their life-sustaining care and treatment, which they may otherwise be unable to get to. with your help, we can do much more! most beneficiaries are referred to us by agency for integrated care (aic) under the medical escort and transportation (met) service. they may be wheelchair users who have chronic diseases or other medical conditions for which they are required to go for regular treatments, therapy or check-ups. currently, more than 90% of our beneficiaries leverage transportaid’s service regularly for their medical appointments and treatments, and the rest for ad-hoc check-ups and follow-ups. how we help within the next ten years, one in five singapore residents will be aged 65 and above. another 200,000 residents, or 3 percent of our population, live with some form of disability. while healthcare may be covered by insurance or government subsidies, the high cost of transportation for disabled individuals makes it untenable for many to receive sustained care. transportaid is offered at subsidised rates in partnership with the agency of integrated care (aic), based on means testing results that are assessed by social workers. for further enquiries or application, you may reach out to aic directly or through your social worker for the met service. for advice on the referral process to the met service: email us or call us volunteer with us volunteer

(other programmes are described in the section care fund programmes.) based in little india, the cuff road project offers a free breakfast and an ample dinner every weekday. on saturday, the meal provided is lunch. our eligibility criteria are straightforward: clients should be documented migrant workers who are out of a job. wellwishers aisha and nasreen (not in picture) contribute diwali sweets to add to workers’ meals why is there a need? migrant workers who are in dispute with their employers, or are injured, have no family here to fall back on. although the law requires employers to provide “upkeep and maintenance”, which in practice may be understood to mean accommodation and food, the reality is that when the relationship has turned acrimonious, employers may not fulfill their obligations willingly. workers report facing enormous pressure to leave their dormitories. they also fear that continuing to stay in company housing exposes them to the risk of forcible repatriation before they’ve received their due salaries or injury compensation. many workers thus leave or are forced out of dormitories. they may have to borrow from friends to pay the monthly rent for a bunk. this leaves them with no margin to pay for adequate food. especially when they are already injured, poor nutrition may retard their recovery. twc2’s cuff road project thus makes an important difference. on average, we serve 400 – 500 workers a day. twc2’s volunteers are stationed at the food point so that workers have someone to talk to and consult. we give advice on what rights and options they may have, and how they can pursue their cases. our volunteers also monitor their progress. the statistics that we compile from the cases we see at the cuff road food programme give us an overall picture of the kinds of difficulties and the scale of exploitation and abuse workers suffer. this knowledge informs our advocacy work. facebook.com/twc2sg instagram.com/twc2sg twitter.com/twc2sg make a difference it takes only a few seconds donatevolunteer donate volunteer © 2023 transient workers count too. website crafted by pixel mechanics page load link go to top"

programmeswebmaster2019-09-04t15:55:46+08:00 care fund programmes whilst the the cuff road project is twc2’s signature project, we also provide assistance to workers in other areas of need. around 2008 when we began to provide such direct assistance, it was done on a small scale from a single care fund. thanks to generous donors, activities under the fund have grown and now our programmes can be broadly classified into six main areas: transport, housing, medical care, legal costs, dayspace, and others. thus the plural: care fund programmes. under the law, employers of foreign workers are required to provide necessary medical care, suitable accommodation (including meals), and medical leave wages when an employee is medically unfit for work (subject to conditions and limits). the reality however is that some employers shirk their responsibilities. complaints lodged with the ministry of manpower can take a long time to be investigated. in the meantime, workers are left with no money, occasionally no medical care and often nowhere to stay. farego unable to work, injured workers often find themselves with a financial problem in addition to their worries over recovery. in theory, they are entitled to salary or medical leave wages (if the doctor has prescribed medical leave), but in reality, bureaucratic or other reasons often mean payment is badly delayed. moreover, because of their low salaries, they have no savings. virtually broke, injured workers find that they do not even have the means to pay for transport to the hospital for their medical appointments or physiotherapy. they simply don’t have money for transport. twc2’s farego programme provides small sums to injured workers so that they can top up their transport fare cards. strict qualifying criteria are applied: applicants must be able to demonstrate that they are not allowed to work, that they have an upcoming medical appointment and that a stipulated exclusion period (since the last top-up) has passed. although at an individual level, the subsidies provided are small, the total amount adds up to over $30,000 annually since there are so many workers in need. project roof under the law, employers are required to continue to house their former employees till their cases are concluded and they go home or they have found a new job. in reality, workers — in the hundreds and maybe thousands — find it impossible to stay on in company quarters. they report a climate of intimidation and constant fear that the company would send in strong-armed repatriation agents in the middle of the night, seizing them and bundling them off to the airport against their will. these fears are not unfounded. twc2 has heard many first-hand reports of such repatriation tactics. in any event, it is entirely conceivable that some companies may try all means to avoid the cost of housing their workers by making it difficult for them to stay on. workers who flee company accommodation may borrow money from friends and relatives to rent a bunk space. but there are some with neither willing friends or relatives in singapore. project roof helps subsidise their rent. the men find their own accommodation — typically a bunk in a crowded tenement in little india — and, subject to eligibility criteria and financial limits set out in our programme, we help pay for it. it goes without saying that there are far more workers in need of such assistance than we can provide. consequently, we apply strict criteria, chief of which is the severity of a worker’s injury. top of the queue would be those who have recently had major surgery, or have suffered a serious injury compromising his mobility and ability to help himself. medical in a typical year, the largest of our care fund programmes goes to providing medical care. whilst the law obliges employers to purchase insurance and thereby provide medical care, the law also sets out maximum limits to this obligation. there is a cap on how much medical costs need be borne by employers for injuries or illnesses. the cap is not unrealistic — in the main, almost all cases would not require more medical care than permitted by the cap. invariably however, there will be outliers. these would be workers who have suffered such severe injures, necessitating major brain surgery or reconstructive surgery, for example, that costs far exceed the amount employers are obliged to pay for. from time to time too, workers come down with illnesses that may require long stays in hospitals or complex treatment, again beyond the legal cap. some employers go well beyond their legal obligation, picking up the tab for extra medical care. others do not. and that’s where twc2 has to come in, on a humanitarian basis to ensure that the ill or injured worker does not see his treatment truncated and his suffering prolonged. twc2 weighs each case very carefully. high priority is given to cases where surgery or medical treatment has a high chance of restoring the patient to an active working life so that he or she can continue to be a breadwinner. where the prognosis is poor, we scale our support accordingly. wednesday clinic in singapore, dispute resolution avenues for injury or salary claims are typified by a two- or three-stage process. for injury cases, the first stage comprises administrative processes under the ministry of manpower, keeping costs low for the claimant workers. should one party disagree with the outcome of this stage, an appeal can be made to the courts — this would be the second stage. for salary cases, the first stage involves mediation organised by the tripartite alliance for dispute management (tadm). if this proves fruitless, the case moves on to the employment claims tribunal (ect) for adjudication. no legal representation is allowed at either tadm or the ect. these initial stages in both injury and salary cases may not require much in terms of financial outlay by claimant workers, though extensive casework support is often needed. our wednesday clinic team provides this intensive support, helping migrant workers overcome educational, language or evidentiary disadvantages during these administrative stages. for example, many are unable to calculate exactly how much they are owed, or how to tease out arguments from whatever documents they have. it is when a case goes beyond the administrative stages to the high court, in the form of appeals, that costs kick in. most cases don’t get this far, but when they do, the financial weakness of migrant workers becomes a barrier to accessing justice. they need legal representation and there are all sorts of costs to be borne, e.g. filing fees, production or extraction of documents, forensic reports, fees for expert witnesses, etc. twc2’s wednesday clinic helps workers find pro-bono lawyers if they have deserving cases. however, pro-bono lawyers are only free in terms of their time and professional services. another party needs to pick up the disbursement costs, and it is here that twc2 has to step in through our care fund. dayspace in order to make twc2 easily approachable to migrant workers, we maintain a “field office” in little india, a district which many migrant workers find familiar. the upstairs space is called “twc2 dayspace”, and is really just one large room that can be configured for a variety of uses. in the daytime and early evenings, volunteers and staff use the space for consultation and various benefit programmes such as farego and meal tokens. the space is also used as an emergency shelter when workers come to us at short notice in need of a place to sleep e.g. because they have been turfed out of employer housing. other in ensuring that the support we give to migrant workers is wholistic, there is no way we can confine care fund activities to strict categories. some flexibility is required. our social work team can tap into the care fund for small sums to help specific workers in areas not covered by the above-mentioned programmes. for example, a worker may need help to top up her phone card so that she can maintain contact with us and her family. or another worker with a leg injury and impaired mobility needs to be taken by a volunteer to hospital for his appointment in a taxi since he cannot take public transport. we’ve also had cases where doctors have ordered special diets for worker patients, and these need to be paid for. hence, we set aside a portion of the care fund each year to cope with these “general” or “miscellaneous” needs. doing so supports our casework in effectiveness and comprehensiveness. facebook.com/twc2sg instagram.com/twc2sg twitter.com/twc2sg make a difference it takes only a few seconds donatevolunteer donate volunteer

its space to meet local needs. the tcm clinical services are free for everyone regardless of religion and race. after serving the local community for more than a decade, the clinic was officially renamed buddhist tzu chi tcm free clinic (redhill) in october 2022. in view of the greying population, tzu chi launched another tcm free clinic in khatib in 2019, with the support and assistance of the nee soon south constituency. the launch ceremony was officiated by the minister for law and home affairs, mr k. shanmugam and mp for nee soon grc, er. dr. lee bee wah on 29 september 2019. besides providing basic tcm clinical services such as acupuncture, moxibustion and cupping, buddhist tzu chi tcm free clinic (khatib) also features holistic services that serve to prevent diseases and improve people’s health. these services include “la jin” (stretching therapy), dietetic therapy, and health education to encourage healthy living. in particular, patients may learn the “la jin” (stretching) exercises from our tcm personnel and do them at home to keep fit.during the covid-19 pandemic, both tcm free clinics strictly adhered to safety measures in treating patients, serving nearly 38,000

for residents in need to shop for free has opened in woodlands. the opening of store@woodlands was announced by sembawang grc mp mariam jaafar on facebook on july 13.these residents would be able to shop for up to nine items each month for free. take what they need, not what others think they need mariam explained that even though its beneficiaries were regularly given food rations, some of the items might not be suited to their dietary requirements or taste. as a response to this quagmire, the community store would stock items that are not usually found in food ration bags such as oyster sauce, curry powder, kicap manis, chocolate and snacks. some of the items that have been ""flying off the shelves"" include nutella. the store currently has 1,800 items on its shelves, with more in storage. photo via mariam jaafar/facebook photo via mariam jaafar/facebook other items that are available include: rice bee hoon instant noodles canned food cooking oil condiments toiletries photo via mariam jaafar/facebook official launch on aug. 1 store@woodlands will be officially launched on aug. 1, 2021. with the help of community gardens, fresh vegetables will be available for selection at the store from the official launch date. photo via mariam jaafar/facebook photo via mariam jaafar/facebook setting up the store mariam and a team of volunteers reached out to potential donors in the community to set up the community store. woodlands digital office developed an inventory tracking system, a welfare team obtained shelves and storage space, and woodlands design studio designed membership cards, logos, posters and signs. in addition, food ration volunteers ""spent nights"" putting a barcode on every item and stocked the shelves with food. mariam also pointed out that many of their volunteers were seniors. photo via mariam jaafar/facebook photo via mariam jaafar/facebook how to donate members of the public who are hoping to make a contribution can do so by donating food and other essential items at an rc center or woodlands community club. all items will be brought to the store once a week. items that are prioritised are listed in the poster below. alternatively, you
