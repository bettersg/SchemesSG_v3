## Background

This backend is built using Firebase Functions and serves as the API for the SchemesSG V3 application. It currently includes two services: `/v1/chat` and `/v1/search`, which are coming soon. The boilerplates for the functions are already set up, with endpoints available for local testing:
- Chat Service: `/v1/chat` (coming soon)
- Search Service: `/v1/search` (coming soon)
- Boilerplate Services (as a guide): 
   - Bar Service: [https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/bar](https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/bar)
   - Foo Service: [https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/foo](https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/foo)
   - Main Service: [https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/main](https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/main)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Firebase CLI**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed, then install Firebase CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

3. **Set up virtual environment**
   Make sure you have python 3.10 installed.
   ```bash
   # Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10
   python3.10 -m venv functions/venv

   # Activate the new virtual environment
   source functions/venv/bin/activate

   # Install the required packages
   python -m pip install -r functions/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Cloud Functions Emulator**
   Start the emulator to test your functions locally:
   ```bash
   export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
   export no_proxy=*
   firebase emulators:start --only functions
   ```

4. **Access the endpoints**
   
   Local Mode 
   - Once the emulator is running, you can issue HTTP requests to the endpoints:
      - Bar Service: [http://127.0.0.1:5001/schemessg-v3-dev/us-central1/bar](http://127.0.0.1:5001/schemessg-v3-dev/us-central1/bar)
      - Foo Service: [http://127.0.0.1:5001/schemessg-v3-dev/us-central1/foo](http://127.0.0.1:5001/schemessg-v3-dev/us-central1/foo)
   
   Staging
   - These endpoints were deployed manually via `firebase deploy --only functions` in the schemessg-v3-dev project. All public users are able to access these endpoints temporarily. 
      - Bar Service: [https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/bar](https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/bar)
      - Foo Service: [https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/foo](https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/foo)
      - Main Service: [https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/main](https://asia-southeast1-schemessg-v3-dev.cloudfunctions.net/main)

## Future Work

- Refactor Fastapi into firebase functions, implement the `/v1/chat` and `/v1/search` functions.
- Use Firestore as database instead of local csv files.
- Set up production deployment configurations.
- Enhance error handling and logging for better debugging.
- Add unit tests for the functions to ensure reliability.
