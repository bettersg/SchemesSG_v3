Driven by Habitat's belief that no human being should live in unsafe, unhygienic or undignified environment, Habitat for Humanity Singapore's Project HomeWorks was launched in 2006. We partner social services to identify such vulnerable persons and families who need help to rehabilitate their homes into a safe and sanitary state.
