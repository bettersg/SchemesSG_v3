    "The specific NLP task at hand is called \"semantic search\" under the field of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential features:\n",
    "- Personally, I wouldn't let people see the whole database cuz nothing good comes out of it\n",
    "- What'd be really cool (& attention capturing) is if we could do multiple searches at once. Split queries by `'\\n'` & return columns of distinct search results\n",
    "- Have maximum length be 100 characters. Encourages succinctness & for users to split separate problems into separate queries.\n",
    "- Have template start with \"My client needs ...\" followed by some examples. Encourages users to focus on the help they would like to receive, not the problem they have or how things will worsen should the problem remain unchecked.\n",
    "- Bold keywords from query if they are present in description\n",
    "- Autocomplete\n",
    "- Autocorrect\n",
    "- If website tracks IP address, for very similar queries within short timespan, return different results\n",
    "- Scold people for vague queries, e.g. \"The more specific you are with your search, the more likely a relevant scheme can be properly identified. Don't worry, we do NOT collect any identifiable information from users.\"\n",
    "- SchemesSG could eventually function as a gapfinder, identifying gaps in social support for common problems"

    "    - Test set == Training set. How often can a model identify that the document most similar to a document is itself?\n",
    "    - Generally anything >95% is satisfactory; the magnitude beyond 95% is meaningless.\n",
    "    - All models are satisfactory in this regard.\n",
    "### 2. Internal validity check #2\n",
    "    - Articles deemed similar to a document should have overlapping labels.\n",
    "    - Assumes labels are good (If labels aren't good, this can help with clustering). Limited to labels that appear more than once.\n",
    "    - Currently there are lenient & strict versions. The lenient version checks if similar documents contain at least 1 label from the reference document. The strict version checks if similar documents contain all the labels from the reference document.\n",
    "    - Strict version is more important; but since we're currently not too sure about the quality of labels, keep the lenient version for now.\n",
    "    - Doc2Vec is best in this regard, hitting ≈77.6% on the strict version, though the rest are close behind.\n",
    "    - The Transformers do better under sparsity, while document vectors & LSI do better with as many columns included as possible."

    "- Seems like cross encoder does better when searches are specific & succinct. Lengthy queries sometimes confuse it & this is where roBERTa occasionally performs better.\n",
    "- roBERTa's results are decent & we could offer them as alternatives if users don't like what is returned. E.g. in the long-term if we evaluate based on whether a user clicked or not, those clicks will likely to be biased towards whatever the cross encoder recommended, which could form an echo chamber. Perhaps for each response, randomly pick 1 of roBERTa's top 3 to be included.\n",
    "- That said, occasionally, roBERTa tends to return results that users may find offensive, e.g. searches for shelter return results about aging in-place, searches for disability employment return schemes for those permanently unable to work, searches for intellectually impaired kids unable to communicate return schemes that are self-help hotlines.\n",
    "- Seems like cross encoder does better when asked to search through just `df['Descriptions']`. When including information from nearly all columns, i.e. `df['Text3']`, performance drops slightly to roBERTa levels. But I haven't tested this extensively.\n",
