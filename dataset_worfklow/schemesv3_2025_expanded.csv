Transit Point @ Margaret Drive,New Hope Community Services,"Years of engaging with rough sleepers on the ground and our continued partnership with the MSF PEERS Network taught us that there is a need for a low-entry, community-based interim shelter to serve rough sleepers with complex housing needs.With the support of MSF, we secured the site of the former Queenstown Polyclinic at 51 Margaret Drive to provide an interim shelter for rough sleepers named Transit Point @ Margaret Drive. Its first hundreds of residents were male and female rough sleepers, as well as displaced persons affected by the Malaysian Government Movement Control Order.Initially a self-funded shelter which started during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, TP@MD obtained subsequent funding support from the National Council of Social Services and the Singapore Totalisator Board in May 2020. TP@MD was also built on the generosity of various community partners and donors, who contributed all kinds of tangible and intangible support. To us, this further exemplified the importance of community in uplifting the lives of the displaced and disadvantaged.Our team at the shelter actively works with residents to facilitate their interim and long term housing goals, empower them with the requisite skills needed to achieve self-reliance and connect them to relevant social resources to meet their holistic needs.

The emotional and psychological impact on the victim can vary significantly from person to person.Sexual violence and assault are never the victim’s fault, and coping with life after the incident can be challenging.- Whether the incident happened years ago or yesterday, we can offer several ways to cope with the emotional and psychological effects of the sexual violence and assaultn- We will work with you to manage your feelings and learn new coping skills to minimise the negative impactn<h6>Healing</h6>Healing from sexual assault is usually a gradual and ongoing process that is often not linear or smooth.

Healing can look drastically different from person to person.- We will support victims to regain the ability to feel safe and to trust, to learn to heal, and move on in life at their own pacen- Some topics include working through grief and facilitate to establish a solid foundation of understanding, safety, stability and self-regulation skillsn- We will journey with the victim through the healing process by ensuring the victim has access to counselling and therapy servicesn<h6>Life after Sexual Assault</h6>It is common for victims to withdraw from social interactions, and to feel isolated and disconnected from others.

Acknowledge how difficult it is for someone to share details of the traumatic incident. Appreciate them for their trust and let them know that you believe them as it encourages them to trust others again.&nbsp;n- **Ask how you can support:** While your first instinct might be to offer advice to your loved one, it is important to let them make their own decisions and choices about what to do next. If this is the first time the victim has disclosed the information, it is likely that they may not know what support you may be able to provide. As such, it is important to ask how you can support.n- **Listen without judgement**: Sexual assault is never the victim’s fault. It is normal to have strong reactions such as anger, sadness or shock when someone you care shares an experience of sexual assualt. Note that sometimes such reactions can make the victim feel responsible, ashamed and discourage them from sharing further or seeking help. Listen without interrupting them and do not ask for details that they do not wish to disclose.&nbsp;n- **Respect their privacy &amp; decisions:** Justice means different things to different people. Attempting to seek ‘justice’ might not be in the victim’s best interest or meet their needs.&nbsp;n- **Encourage them to seek help: **We have professionals who can work with them to support them better.&nbsp;n- **Keep supporting:** Healing and recovery takes time, support them along the way.

Boys’ Town Residential Services,Boys’ Town Residential Services,"Boys’ Town Residential Services is a children and young persons home providing residential care for boys between the age of 10 to 21 in Singapore. We are a residential home for disadvantaged and disengaged youths with programmes catered exclusively to **male** residents only. Children and young persons admitted into our residential home are those who are: from dysfunctional families and in need of shelter; abused or neglected; in need of care and protection; under family guidance orders; and in conflict with the Law.As a residential [children’s home in Singapore](https://www.boystown.org.sg/), we aim to transform the lives of at-risk youth. Our comprehensive programmes offer a safe and supportive environment, empowering these young individuals to overcome challenges and build a brighter future. From education and vocational training to counselling and mentoring, we provide holistic care that fosters personal growth and resilience.**Types of Needs**Child ProtectionAs a residential children’s home, Boys’ Town serves as a sanctuary for those facing unsafe or abusive environments. We provide physical safety, emotional, and psychological support to young individuals, and help them to recover from their past experiences.Family Guidance OrdersSome youngsters find themselves struggling with behavioural issues that can't be effectively addressed within a traditional family context. The Family Order Guidance (formerly known as Beyond Parental Control) refers these children and youth to residential home services such that they can benefit from a structured and nurturing environment. These children and youth can then receive focused guidance to overcome challenges, learn essential life skills, and establish positive habits.Lack of Family SupportChildren and at-risk youths may need residential support due to a lack of family support, often stemming from circumstances beyond parental control. These residential programmes for kids offer more than just accommodation; they provide holistic care, educational opportunities, and emotional guidance, filling the gap left by absent or unable family structures.Behavioral DysregulationBehaviors resulting from trauma, emotional struggles, or other underlying issues might lead children and youths to require specialised residential care. In Boys’ Town, expert staff, including trained psychologists and social workers, offer tailored interventions to help these individuals regulate their behaviour, develop coping mechanisms, and build a solid foundation for a healthier future.**Our Residential Units**<h3>SHELTER</h3>For boys aged 10 to 16 with child protection concerns. They usually come from abused or neglected family backgrounds, and some may also be facing social and economic difficulties at home.Approach: Uses Trauma-Informed Care as the backbone of the work to ensure safety and empower the residents. As these boys have higher needs, they will be assigned a mentor each to guide and support them throughout their stay.<h3>GROUP HOME</h3>For boys aged 13 to 16 who exhibit delinquent traits and are under the Family Guidance Order (previously known as Beyond Parental Control) or under a Probation Order. These boys tend to show higher risk issues such as stealing, running away from home, etc.Approach: With ""Social Control Theory"" as a theoretical framework, employs socialisation to decrease the chances of delinquent behaviour. [Counselling for young children](https://www.boystown.org.sg/clinical-intervention-centre/youth-counselling) may also be conducted for our residents in our group home.<h3>THERAPEUTIC GROUP HOME (TGH)</h3>A residential treatment programme for boys aged 13 and above who have experienced significant trauma and exhibit severe emotional and behavioural dysregulation which affect their daily functioning.Each resident will typically stay in TGH for a 12 to 18-month period. Weekly therapy sessions will be conducted with the TGH Clinical team.Approach: Adopts Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) and Positive Behavioural Interventions and Supports (PBIS) in their model of care. Regular group sessions will be conducted to teach residents on emotional regulation techniques.<h3>HOSTEL</h3>An independent unit that is designed for youths between 17 – 21 years old who have no other forms of family support.Monthly group work sessions are conducted to equip the hostel residents on independent living skills such as financial management, and self management.Approach: Assigned social worker to work on individual issues and monthly group work to build peer social support.",,https://www.boystown.org.sg/residential-services/,,,"Shelters , Children's Homes",,6690 5420,info@boystown.org.sg,624 Upper Bukit Timah Road,
Chen Su Lan Methodist Children's Home,Chen Su Lan Methodist Children's Home,"Chen Su Lan Methodist Children's Home (CSLMCH) provides temporary shelter, care, and protection to boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 21 years old who come from needy and disadvantaged families in Singapore. Our Home is one of the biggest children's homes in Singapore.There are usually 70 - 90 boys and girls living in the Children's Home and every year, 20 - 30 children are admitted or discharged back into their families or community.<h4>The Children</h4>Our children come from different ethnic and religious backgrounds and different regions of Singapore. They are not orphans. The majority are from low income, broken, dysfunctional or abusive families whose parents cannot, will not or should not care for them. Broken families are usually single parents who are imprisoned or facing severe financial difficulties or health issues. Dysfunctional families are usually parents who have mental health issues, addictions or who have abandoned their children. Abusive families have seriously neglected or emotionally, sexually or physically abused their children (or failed to protect them) so their children have been removed by the courts and placed in our Home for their own protection. Some of our children also have special needs (ADHD, low IQ) and their parents cannot manage them.The children are referred to us by community partners like the Family Service Centers, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) or the Court (either on Compassionate Grounds, MSF Referred or by Court Order). We do not admit children directly and the decision to admit a child is always taken carefully. We only accept children between 5 &amp; 16 years old and only when there are no other family members or foster parents able to care for them.Some children stay in the Home for a couple of months, the majority (80%) stay for 6 months to 5 years and some remain in the Home for their entire childhood. It all depends on their family situation.<h4>The Children's Home</h4>Our mission is to provide loving, Christian nurture to needy and disadvantaged children of all races and religions so as to prepare them to be happy and responsible members of their family and community. The main Residential Home works to achieve this in 3 ways:\n&nbsp;- Care -&nbsp; \nWe provide the children with shelter, care and protection. The Children's Home has a playground, a kitchen, a dining hall, a chapel, a large multipurpose hall and six houses where the children sleep (3 for the girls &amp; 3 for the boys). The children live in the Home but they go to their former schools during the week. Our residential care and support staff ensure that they are protected, cared for and provided with everything they need 24 hours a day in the Home.\n&nbsp;n- Development -&nbsp; \nWe try to heal and develop the children. Many of the children are angry, ashamed, traumatised or dysfunctional due to their past experiences or family backgrounds. Some are so hurt, that they cannot self-regulate or understand their emotions. Our staff therefore practice Trauma Informed Care (a care structure that recognises &amp; seeks to heal children suffering from trauma); the most traumatised children are given professional counselling and therapy; our education manager monitors the academic progress of the children and recommends extra tuition when needed; our chaplain counsels and teaches the children about Jesus and Christian values; and our partners, sponsors and volunteers provide support, friendship and enrichment programmes to inspire the children and develop their interests, talents and self-confidence.\n&nbsp;n- Reunification -&nbsp; \nWe try to reunite the children back into their families as soon and safely as possible. Most of the boys and girls want to go back to their parents and CSLMCH believes that children are always better off living with their families than in a Children's Home. So our social workers help their families to solve their problems and encourage them to see their children as often as possible. And when the parents (or other family members) are able to care for them again, the children are discharged from the Children's Home and monitored for 2 years afterwards to ensure that the reunification process is safe and successful. Children who cannot be reunited with their families can stay in the Children's Home until they are 21 years old and have finished school, started working or gone into National Service or they can be put up for fostering.&nbsp;n",,https://www.cslmch.org.sg/the-childrens-home,,,"Shelters , Children's Homes",,6713 9150,info@cslmch.org.sg,202 Serangoon Garden Way,

Community Development,Allkin,"Guided by the Asset-Based Community Development approach, Allkin Singapore facilitates opportunities and platforms that enable interdependence and mutual care among community members.n## What We Do\nGuided by the Asset-Based Community Development approach, Allkin Singapore facilitate opportunities and platforms that enable interdependence and mutual care among community members. Everyday citizens, including our clients, contribute their strengths, talents and experiences towards the well-being of their community, and towards supporting the vulnerable in their neighbourhood. They also work alongside professionals to co-create solutions that not only address the community’s needs, but also enable it to become more resilient.n## How We Enhance &amp; Enrich Lives\nHere is how we contribute to the social service sector in thought leadership and capacity building:<h3>Thought leadership and Impact to the Social Service Sector</h3>In response to the urgent need for community building, we partner with like-minded individuals and organisations to lead the social service sector towards change through thought leadership and capacity building.We conduct sector training and learning journeys for professionals, volunteers, and residents to prepare the sector to be ready to shift towards a community-driven approach to building an ecosystem of care, where community is empowered to support one another to address emerging challenges.<h3>Community Hubs</h3>As part of our focus on community-building, our two Community Hubs situated at Blk 414 and Blk 643 in Ang Mo Kio act as catalysts in bridging social connections in the neighbourhood, enabling residents to lead ground-up initiatives for their neighbours, and encouraging interdependence and mutual self-help among community members.Through community participation and action, residents also contribute their gifts and assets towards the wellbeing of their own community and the vulnerable in their neighbourhood.<h3>Community Trails</h3>Our community trails are immersive resident-curated learning journeys that involve residents sharing the discoveries of strengths and gifts in their community.\n\nThis trail brings people around the neighbourhood, and highlights the stories of individuals, associations, local economies, institutions, and others who have helped shape the well-being of the community.<h3>Community Celebrations</h3>Festive occasions and events, such as birthdays, school holidays carnivals and block parties, are a common staple in community life.\n\nThese celebrations bring people from different walks of life to share and build a network of support within the community. Therefore, fostering a spirit where residents are more welcoming of others in the margins and willing to extend a helping hand to those in need.<h3>Community Walks</h3>Discovery is a vital process in building communities, as we may not know what is already out there. Through community walks, we discover the concerns, interests and hopes of residents, and map these diverse assets and needs. \n\nWe then foster the connections between people who may have some needs to the gifts and skills available. Through time and intentional engagements, these connections grow into trusting relationships where help is no longer asked but willingly offered.<h3>Community Lunches</h3>Our community lunches are by-resident-for-resident initiatives that bring together neighbours through food. Residents contribute towards preparing and as they share a meal with fellow neighbours, they build a trust and connection with each other.\n\nThrough this, we create an interdependent relationship where fellow residents naturally look out for each other in times of need.<h3>Community Food Distributions</h3>Our resident-led fresh food distribution project aims to enable low-income families to improve their access to healthy, nutritious food learn more about how they can incorporate healthy eating into their lifestyle.\n\nBy mobilising community partners such as local market vendors in community to donate groceries, and medical health professionals who give insight into healthy eating, community members are able to meaningfully reach out to and engage vulnerable neighbours in their community on a regular basis.<h3>Uniqlo Corner</h3>In collaboration with residents and our corporate partner Uniqlo Singapore, the Uniqlo Corner aims to bridge the gap of access to clothes for low-income families through the giving away of preloved Uniqlo clothes.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, resident volunteers also organised Facebook Live session to distribute the Uniqlo clothing to fellow neighbours who might benefit from them.<h3>Photovoice Community Gallery&nbsp;</h3>Photovoice is a research project that uncovered the assets and gems within a neighbourhood. Over six months, 35 residents from diverse backgrounds captured the places, spaces, and faces of Ang Mo Kio that enhanced the lives of its people.&nbsp;\n\nThese residents and student volunteers co-curated the Photovoice Community Gallery at Blk 414 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10, which was launched officially by Allkin's Honorary Advisor Dr Vasoo and CEO Dr Vincent Ng.Discover the gems captured by the residents in [English](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ujrdx6te/production/670ac7a3b04363deb86763974b4fb5613545f82a.pdf), [Malay](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ujrdx6te/production/d9a7b394b8d6de0eb2cbaefe93689446f9ac7cd6.pdf), [Mandarin](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ujrdx6te/production/85fdf6cf7d8393e10b12551c6293c7763d4ccff7.pdf), or [Tamil](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ujrdx6te/production/37242029ad70ad1758de411fb717ddd3e56bf6b5.pdf)!",,https://www.allkin.org.sg/services/community-development,,,"Volunteering , Community",,9620 7450,community414@allkin.org.sg,414 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #01-917,

Art Therapy

Occupational Therapy
We help residents achieve a better quality of life through intensive occupational therapy. Our efforts focus on three components of occupational performance. These are the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), leisure and vocational engagement.
Psychological Services

Conducted by mental health professionals, these sessions may consist of individualised assessments and interventions, psychoeducation, cognitive training, anger management and social skills training.
We also provide treatment that is informed by the findings of the assessments. Treatment is conducted through individual therapy or group therapy at the Activity Hub or via outreach.
Social Work
We manage the needs and condition of each resident through individualised case management. Job and social assessments, personal skills training sessions and support groups are also conducted to create an engaging rehabilitative environment for residents.

Our activities include creative therapeutic interventions, individual art therapy and counselling with creative approaches. Our integrated model is open to the public and helps to encourage awareness, relieve stress and improve quality of life.**We offer a range of services that integrates expressive arts:**<h5>**Creative therapeutic interventions**</h5>Learn new skills and express your feelings through visual arts, music and dance. A relaxing way to meet people from all walks of life. We offer new activities and themes every month!<h5>**Art Therapy and Counselling with Creative Approaches**</h5>Like physical health, mental health is constantly changing and needs to be looked after. The way we deal with our daily situations and emotions is influenced by how upbeat or low we are feeling. Poor mental health can affect the way we feel, think, or behave; in turn, affecting our responses to a stressful situation, social interactions, or decision-making process.Art therapy can be a safe and healthy outlet to make sense of these strong emotions and challenging life experiences Individuals may have difficulty expressing these emotions or thoughts in words. Hence, an alternative to seeing a counsellor or therapist, may be using art as a medium of expression. Art therapy is the integration of art and psychotherapy. Art offers a way for visual communication, and the therapist works to facilitate further discussion and reflection. The process of art-making offers a way for individuals to express themselves and make sense of any unprocessed emotions or memories.Art therapy can benefit any individual, and it is not limited to clients diagnosed with mental health conditions. Individuals may engage in this therapeutic art-making process to enhance and maintain their mental well-being or may consider engaging it for personal growth.

Seniors Engagement & Enabling Node,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"Singapore is one of the countries in the world with the lowest fertility rate and highest life expectancy. It is reported that by 2030, one in every four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older. Hence, the government has introduced many measures and policies to deliver more effective community healthcare services to the increasing elderly population.In Tzu Chi, Master Cheng Yen encourages the elderly to lead useful lives like young people, as they have a wealth of life experience and are able to continue to contribute to society (if their health permits). Besides, she emphasizes that staying active both physically and mentally is crucial to preventing age-related diseases.Consistent with Master Cheng Yen’s call for the elderly to lead active lives, Tzu Chi Singapore accepts the appointment by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to operate two Eldercare Centres in the west district—SEEN@Nanyang and SEEN@Bukit Batok, which were officiated by respective Members of the Parliament and representatives of the districts' Residents' Committee. These centres offer active ageing, befriending, and care services to senior citizens, thereby supporting the government’s efforts to promote healthy and happy ageing.The name, “Seniors Engagement &amp; Enabling Node” (SEEN), reflects the Ministry of Health’s new plan for Eldercare Centres to serve as drop-in centres for seniors as well as a community link to help seniors stay healthy through engagement with various activities. Designed based on the five components of intergenerational bonding, artistry therapy, gardening, culinary arts, and strength training, SEEN reaches out to senior residents living in the nearby studio apartments and surrounding neighbourhoods.Our Four Strategic Thrusts are as follows:- **Activate** – Allow seniors to stay connected with the communityn- **Engage** – Allow seniors to curate shared experiences and foster camaraderien- **Empower** – Enable seniors to form self-help and cross-care groupsn- **Safeguard** – Help seniors to stay healthy physically and socio-psychologicallynSEEN also adopted the National University Hospital Singapore's Healthy Ageing Promotion Programme for You (HAPPY), which aims to help the elderly maintain optimum physical and mental health. In addition, it collaborates with the Lien Foundation to provide “Gym Tonic”, a senior-friendly strength-training programme which helps to reverse physical frailty through the use of software-enabled gym equipment designed to gently build the elderly’s core muscle groups.&nbsp;A physiotherapy team will also be on duty two days each week to serve seniors with chronic ailments, such as backache, pain in the neck and knees, etc.&nbsp;Supported by an existing team of healthcare professionals from the Tzu Chi Free Clinic, Lakeside Family Medicine Clinic, Day Rehabilitation Centre, etc., SEEN offers various programmes and services that enhance the wellbeing of seniors.

Council for Third Age,Council for Third Age,"The Council for Third Age, C3A, set up in May 2007, is an agency which promotes active ageing in Singapore through public education, outreach and partnerships. As an umbrella body in the active ageing landscape, with its focus on lifelong learning, senior volunteerism, and positive ageing, C3A works with and through partners to help third agers age well.C3A is the administrator of National Silver Academy (NSA) and the Silver Volunteer Fund (SVF), as part of the initiatives under the Action Plan for Successful Ageing.Through various initiatives and platforms, third agers can self-discover and enhance their different dimensions of wellness in their journey of positive ageing. C3A aims to create a vibrant pro-age Singapore where seniors can participate as integral members of society.Find out more about C3A at&nbsp;[https://corporate.c3a.org.sg/](https://corporate.c3a.org.sg/)n## National Silver Academy\nThe idea for a senior learning academy first began in 2015, after we received feedback from seniors about their desire to spend more of their time learning, both for work and for interest. They felt that learning activities helped them to keep their mind active, as well as stay socially engaged and in touch with current affairs.The National Silver Academy (NSA) was thus formed.Comprising a network of course providers, the NSA offers a wealth of learning opportunities that were never before so widely available to the public. Universities like NUS, NTU, SMU and SUSS, and the polytechnics are now open to seniors who want to pursue courses without taking exams. This is in addition to existing part-time and short course programmes that already cater to current working adults.&nbsp;Beyond the universities and polytechnics, the NSA also offers courses – from the arts institutions, ITE and community-based organisations. Another unique feature of the NSA is that its courses cover life skills, in fields as varied as gerontology, media, design, finance, IT, the humanities and the arts, among others.NSA courses are subsidised for seniors aged 50 and above, and most courses are SkillsFuture Credit eligible too.Check out the full list of courses below:- [Short courses](https://c3a.org.sg/short-courses)n- [Exam-free modules](https://c3a.org.sg/exam-free-modules)n- [Ad hoc learning opportunities](https://c3a.org.sg/intergenerational-learning-programme)n",,https://www.c3a.org.sg/,,,"Seniors , Education",,6478 5029,nsa@c3a.org.sg,Junction 8 (Office Tower)\n9 Bishan Place #10-01,

Eco Points,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"**Disclaimer: **Tzu-Chi Foundation (Singapore) did not set up any social media account focusing on the Environmental Protection mission and does not provide monetary rewards for recycling items collections or request app installations.Every third Sunday of the month is Tzu Chi Environmental Sustainability Day. In more than 30 neighbourhoods across the island, Tzu Chi has garnered the support of various Residents’ Committees, to transform the void decks of HDB blocks, communal pavilions, activity areas, etc. into temporary eco points. Residents living nearby are invited to bring their recyclable items for sorting and recycling on Environmental Sustainability Day. They are also encouraged to bring their children along to learn about environmental protection.Under the guidance of dedicated volunteers, each&nbsp;Tzu Chi Environmental Sustainability Day is a community activity that promotes kinship and good neighbourliness. Besides doing sorting work hands-on, the volunteers also share knowledge about environmental protection in a warm and friendly atmosphere. After completing the half-day task of sorting the recyclables according to their material, everyone will work together to clean up each venue and restore the venue to its original clean state. Proceeds from the sale of all recyclables are then used to support Tzu Chi's programmes and services that benefit our local communities.While doing sorting work, the volunteers become more aware of the wasteful habits of a consumerist culture. The experience inspires them to reflect on their own lives, and they start living a less wasteful lifestyle and curbing unnecessary consumption, thereby reducing the amount of trash generated.Master Cheng Yen describes the&nbsp;Environmental Protection Volunteer as “Grassroots Bodhi”, akin to the roots of grasses that protect the soil and water. When every household carries out green practices, we can protect and save our planet.We warmly invite you and your family to join our ranks of environmental defenders and serve as guardians of Mother Earth!&nbsp;<h3>Sorting of Recyclables</h3>The recyclables in Tzu Chi’s Eco Points are sorted into the following categories to help reduce the burden of the recycling merchants in handling the recyclables and also increase the sales value of the materials:- **Paper**: waste paper, envelope, book, newspaper,&nbsp;magazine, cardboard, carton boxn- **Aluminium**:&nbsp;aluminium cann- **Metals**: metal cann- **Hardware**:&nbsp;copper, bronze, stainless steel, metal partsn- **Electrical appliances (Non-regulated items)**: electrical fan, rice cooker, DVD player, microwave, camera, vacuum cleaner, soundbar, blendern- **Clothing**:&nbsp;shirt, pants, belt, handbag, shoes,&nbsp;backpackn- **Glass:** glass bottle, containern**Please note that the following items are not collected at our eco points:**\n*All plastic items, Polystyrene foam, PVC material, rubber container, furniture, wood product, pottery, aquarium, mirror, pillow, diaper, undergarment, socks*We seek your cooperation in doing some preliminary sorting at home. If the items have been contaminated by oil stains, food residues, etc., kindly clean them at home before sending them for recycling. In this way, we can prevent cross-contamination with other recyclables, while also safeguard the volunteers doing the sorting work.**Note:&nbsp;***\n*We do not provide collection of recyclables from homes and offices.\n*All collected recyclables are sold to recycling companies.&nbsp;*[FAQs](https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/about-us/tzu-chi-singapore/faq/#goto-q5)<h3>Tzu Chi Environmental Sustainability Day (Monthly)</h3>**Every 3rd Sunday of the month, 9am – 12pm**<h3>Community Eco Points Island-wide\n</h3><hr>**\nAljunied**\n[Blk 98 Aljunied Crescent, S380098](https://goo.gl/maps/s5BqtBqHRXNcGY1S8)**\nAng Mo Kio**\n[Blk 322 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, S560322](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hh3MsHv4U8PsnxVF6)**\nAng Mo Kio**\n[Blk 541 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, S560541](https://goo.gl/maps/O5vOr)**\nAng Mo Kio\n**[Blk 624 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, S560624](https://goo.gl/maps/yhPSGzKd6LB2)**\nBedok\n**[Blk 79 Bedok North Road, S460079](https://goo.gl/maps/D7zZqyjqzKQ2)**\nBedok\n**[Blk 109 Bedok North Road, S460109](https://goo.gl/maps/N49817UetrNbNySo6)**\nBukit Batok\n**[Blk 185 Bukit Batok West Avenue 6, S650185](https://goo.gl/maps/GCDyqPw9TaNbtFrB7)**\nBukit Batok\n**[Blk 268 Bukit Batok East Avenue 4, S650268](https://goo.gl/maps/KhtPMYcvXUvHFtsK7)**\nBukit Batok\n**[Blk 369 Bukit Batok Street 31, S650369](https://goo.gl/maps/UzMYR)**\nBukit Merah**\n[Blk 109 Jalan Bukit Merah, S160109](https://goo.gl/maps/mD2qJE9KGvofw1HL9)**\nBukit Panjang\n**[Blk 150 Petir Road, S670150](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CSCLqUfrFzHwsHd78)**\nBukit Panjang\n**[Blk 440 Fajar Road, S670440](https://goo.gl/maps/dPje8PH3Hc5sKBiP6)**\nChoa Chu Kang\n**[Blk 474 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3, S680474](https://goo.gl/maps/czhIg)**\nChoa Chu Kang**\n[Blk 621 Choa Chu Kang Street 62, S680621](https://goo.gl/maps/BKpxHPboRAR2TigB8)**\nGhim Moh**\n[Blk 7A Ghim Moh Road, S270007](https://goo.gl/maps/7rfgBBf2MzFqLJaQ6)**\nHougang**\n[Blk 112 Hougang Avenue 1, S530112](https://goo.gl/maps/N2JwLuAvwG22)**\nJurong East\n**[Blk 229 Jurong East Street 21, S600229](https://goo.gl/maps/pVBRQZ6wwMCqNCZb9)**\nJurong East\n**[Blk 258 Jurong East Street 24, S600258](https://goo.gl/maps/7dUyxwgpTgzXgFez9)**\nJurong West\n**[Blk 510 Jurong West Street 52, S640510](https://goo.gl/maps/oUr6rKCEvce63eMC7)**\nJurong West**\n[Blk 931 Jurong West Street 92, S640931](https://goo.gl/maps/P6XHkARJNEky8ubt5)**\n****\nMarine Parade\n**[Blk 34 Marine Crescent, S440034](https://goo.gl/maps/bi6hsYeJxuUmZ4Hf7)**\nMarine Parade\n**[Blk 76 Marine Drive, S44007](https://goo.gl/maps/mCvVC)**\nPasir Ris**\n[Blk 429 Pasir Ris Drive 6, S510429](https://goo.gl/maps/SKEDuAjTTG6Ljzdu7)**\nPasir Ris**\n[Blk 601 Elias Road, S510601](https://goo.gl/maps/faLHn5W2xAnDReqa7)**\nPunggol**\n[Blk 164 Punggol Central, S820164 (MPH)](https://goo.gl/maps/xmuGzvq7Hs4tGLJm9)**\nRedhill**\n[Blk 84A Redhill Lane, S150084 (MPH)](https://goo.gl/maps/JW3rhFfGgyxwKPKR7)**\nSengkang\n**[Blk 216 Compassvale Drive, S541216 (MPH)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fhmPikxYFDfh3gH76)**\nSerangoon\n**[Blk 241 Serangoon Avenue 3, S550241](https://goo.gl/maps/UshMkuYrSEEYY2AF6)**\nTampines\n**[Blk 202 Tampines Street 21, S520202](https://goo.gl/maps/XxvyJkUcvtBadzF77)**\nTampines\n**[Blk 331 Tampines St 32, S520331](https://goo.gl/maps/7WGPfCfvUNH3skS87)**\nToa Payoh\n**[The Pavilion @ 78A Toa Payoh Central, S311078](https://goo.gl/maps/wdZri74RAoU89Jqd9)**\nWoodlands\n**[Blk 682B Woodlands Drive 62, S732682](https://goo.gl/maps/RUQFf)**\nWoodlands\n**[Blk 816 Woodlands St 82, S730816](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5NaxRsyAqGxXbXhBA)**\nYishun\n**[Blk 701 Yishun Avenue 5, S760701](https://goo.gl/maps/3XkuKZPP4eKdy4ZC7)**\nYishun\n**[Blk 813 Yishun Ring Road, S760813](https://goo.gl/maps/97e9oS411am)**\nYishun (Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth Centre)\n**[30A Yishun Central 1, S768796](https://goo.gl/maps/egFyVrHtnVbJF6rh8)**\nThe collection is held every 3rd Sunday of the month, 9am – 12pm**[Check the dates on Event page&nbsp;](https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/events/tzu-chi-environmental-sustainability-day/)",,https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/our-missions/environmental-protection/eco-points/,,,"Others , Environmental Initiatives",,,,,

How can you play your part to curtail this troubling trend?Project HopeUpon diagnosis, kidney failure patients and caregivers tend to feel a sense of hopelessness as it marks the beginning of a long journey of battling with a chronic illness. Due to the stress of dealing with the illness and the need to undergo dialysis thrice weekly, many patients face emotional, economic, and psychosocial challenges. Do you have an idea to help them improve their quality of life and integrate them back into society?Project ImpactThere are many in society who are under-resourced or often neglected, how can you fill that need? We encourage you to seek ways to do good for the community by bringing people together and addressing a social need. Also, weave in kidney health awareness into your project to encourage the community to care for their health.

SGStrong,The Majurity Trust,"SG Strong started as a crisis response fund during Covid pandemic in 2020 to support groundup initiatives.
In partnership with GIC, it has now evolved to become Singapore’s first Groundup Leader Fellowship - investing in outstanding community leaders to deliver systems-level change.
When Covid-19 hit our shores, The Majurity Trust with the support of Singapore-based family foundations, philanthropists and corporate partners launched the SG Strong Fund in 2020 as a crisis response fund. It was the start of challenging times for Singapore. But the unprecedented difficulties compelled us to do more for groundup initiatives that rose up to face the challenges head-on. 10 donors rallied together with $550,000 to launch the fund.
In 2021, as the situation stabilised, we turned our efforts to focus on recovery from the crisis. With support from the Community Foundation of Singapore, we launched Groundup@Sg as a second phase of SG Strong, supporting groundup initiatives that were helping to build more resilient communities on the ground.
The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve today. The fear that gripped us at the start of the crisis has given way to a new normal as our society adjusts and copes. Despite the unprecedented difficulties we have been facing, we continue to see an overwhelming outpouring of kindness, strength and resilience in our community. We are humbled and encouraged by the opportunity that The Majurity Trust has been given to support and enable the groundup initiatives to do good.
As we move forward, we remain certain that a flourishing groundup ecosystem is key to a resilient and crisis-ready Singapore, with community activators leading the way.
In 2023, with the support of GIC, we have evolved the SG Strong Fund into the SG Strong Fellowship, nurturing a network of groundup leaders ready to forge a new frontier for a thriving groundup community",,https://www.majurity.sg/funds-and-grants/sgstrong/,,,"Grants , Grants for Ground Ups and SSAs",,,,,

However, amid all the debate and discussion about improving the welfare of migrant workers, what is becoming clear is that there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to this multi-faceted issue.

Tzu Chi Renal Dialysis Centre,Tzu Chi Renal Dialysis Centre,"Every day, approximately six new cases of kidney failure are diagnosed in Singapore, as reported by the Singapore Renal Registry Annual Report 2022. Singapore has the highest global prevalence of diabetes-induced kidney failure. This rising trend has resulted in greater demand for subsidised dialysis and longer waiting times for placement at non-profit dialysis centres in the community.In September 2022, the National Kidney Foundation (Singapore) warned of a looming ""Kidney Tsunami"" in our nation. This alarming trend highlights the urgent need for proactive measures to address the growing prevalence of chronic illnesses and kidney diseases in Singapore.With decades of experience in [caring for renal patients and assisting financially needy Singaporeans](https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/our-missions/charity/medical-assistance/) since 2005, Tzu Chi has significantly alleviated the financial burdens of dialysis. To help reduce waiting times for patients at non-profit dialysis centres, we expanded our efforts and invested six years in establishing our first community dialysis centre. Strategically located in the northeastern part of the island, the centre is ideally positioned to meet the needs of renal patients in that region.With approval from the Ministry of Health and support from the National Kidney Foundation (Singapore), the Tzu Chi Renal Dialysis Centre in Buangkok began operations in March 2024. This milestone marks the Foundation’s first foray into establishing and managing such a facility. Our efforts complement those of other non-profit organisations, including the National Kidney Foundation, in offering affordable, high-quality haemodialysis treatment to the community. We look forward to ongoing collaboration with our partners as we work together to avert the anticipated ""Kidney Tsunami.""NKF supports Tzu Chi’s initiative to establish the Foundation’s first dialysis centre with concrete actions, culminating in the [signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on 29&nbsp;March](https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/news-and-stories/local-news/nkf-provides-tzu-chi-with-free-training-to-improve-dialysis-centres-quality-of-care/), 2023.

Home Care Services,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"In order to allow more elderly residents to spend their golden years in the comfort of their own homes, Tzu Chi Singapore developed a patient-centred, integrated healthcare model, by consolidating its existing healthcare staff and volunteers, to provide well-coordinated, seamless services to homebound (mostly elderly) patients. As home medical care services&nbsp;gradually gained attention over time, the Foundation decided to expand its home care services in 2014, thus bringing to life Master Cheng Yen’s hope of reaching out to the sick who are unable to go out and seek medical help.Since more than 10 years ago, TIMA Singapore’s medical volunteers have started conducting medical home visits to the homes of Tzu Chi’s aid beneficiaries who were homebound due to illnesses. With the expansion of the local Mission of Medicine, the medical team discovered the alarming increase in demand for home medical services. Thus, Tzu Chi took the initiative to contact the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), to discuss how they might work together to provide home healthcare services for needy and sick residents. Subsequently, from 2014 to 2017, the “Tzu Chi Home Care Services” programme was implemented to serve the underprivileged homebound patients referred by the AIC.Tzu Chi Home Care Services include the provision of medical and nursing care as well as rehabilitation services in the homes of the patients. The services include indwelling urinary catheter care, change of nasogastric tube, care of artificial stoma, change of dressing, checking and sorting medications, etc. Members of the Home Care team also seek to understand the patients’ family backgrounds, home environment, and even their mental and emotional health, in order to adjust the level of care according to each individual’s needs.Family members are often the ones closest to the patients, to provide personal care for them. Hence, the Home Care team will also train and counsel the patients’ family members on appropriate nursing and home care skills. Friendships are built over time between the team members and the patients and their families, through the small gestures of love and care. The warmth and comfort of the team’s companionship as well as their provision of additional services, such as home cleaning and application for financial assistance (for needy households), allow the patients to recuperate in the peace and comfort of their own homes and also help allay the concerns of their loved ones.",,https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/our-missions/medicine/home-care-services/,,,"Seniors , Home Care",,6569 2236,homecare@tzuchi.org.sg,,

We also focus our efforts on providing training on wheelchair handling to caregivers to prevent accidents and ensure proper care for the equipment.On 4 October 2017, Minister of Social and Family Development, Mr Desmond Lee launched the Temasek Foundation Cares – Kampung Senang Wheelchair Servicing Programme, to train senior volunteers to service the wheelchairs of needy seniors",,https://www.kampungsenang.org/mobility-aids,,,"Health and Medical , Persons with Disabilities , Physical Disabilities | Family Services , Items Assistance",,6261 1157,corporatecomm@kampungsenang.org,Block 324 Jurong East Street 31 #01-130,
Medical Assistance,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"Many a times, poverty is intertwined with illness and disability. Some people became poor after contracting a major disease or becoming disabled due to an accident. Such irreversible physical condition usually cost the unfortunate their career and thus the loss of financial stability. Hence, medical assistance is part of the schemes under Tzu Chi Mission of Charity to serve the needy community better. &nbsp;Besides providing subsidies for medical expenses, the provision of medical supplies is also a major feature of our medical assistance programme. For long-term users who are struggling with their own limited financials, when the annual costs of their medical supplies constantly outstrip the limits of government grants and allowances, Tzu Chi will step in to fill the gap.Volunteers sort medical supplies, such as adult diapers, waste bags, nutritional milk, etc. according to type, size, quantity, and home address, before personally delivering them to individual households during the monthly home visits.The types of medical assistance provided by Tzu Chi are as follows:Medical consumables\nInterim dialysis fees\nMedical transport fees\nDay care fees&nbsp; &nbsp;\nHIV medication fees\nAntenatal check fees",,https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/our-missions/charity/medical-assistance/,,,"Financial Aid and Food Aid , Financial Aid , Medical Subsidies | Family Services , Items Assistance",,6582 9958,info@tzuchi.org.sg,,[https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/contact-us/enquiry-form/](https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/contact-us/enquiry-form/)

Play It Forward,Play It Forward,"Public pianos around Singapore for all to play!Play it Forward Singapore is a homegrown public piano movement launched by three piano nerds in September 2015.The idea first came about when we heard about the large number of old pianos being thrown away every year. Many people we know love to play the piano, but stopped doing so for various reasons. Hundreds of neglected pianos are gathering dust in homes across Singapore right now. At the same time, there are some among us who cannot afford to own a piano or do not have access to this instrument.So we thought, why not rescue these unwanted instruments and share them with everyone?We wanted people to love playing music again, so we decided to place these pianos in public spaces as public instruments that anyone can play on anytime. But what if these pianos can look interesting too? We collaborated with local artists and designers to transform old pianos into public art pieces, while remaining as functional instruments that are a joy to play on.As musicians ourselves, we are particular about the sound quality of the old pianos and will do everything we can to make sure that everyone enjoys playing on them in a location with good acoustics. We hire professionals to tune all our public pianos, and sometimes we ourselves give it a go at repairing the hammers and strings!Till today, we have restored more than 20 pianos into public art installations which were donated to needy beneficiaries after the public run. Our public pianos have since traveled to more than 16 locations in the city and played by thousands of people since.We have seen people whose faces lit up with a smile when a friend sits down to play a tune, musicians who now have a place to practise and perform, urban spaces transformed into places for interaction and bonding, and numerous videos of beautiful performances on the street by musicians and curious onlookers. It makes our day when we see people gathering around the pianos and enjoying the music in the Singapore city.We have successfully completed our fourth edition of public pianos in the city and preparing for our latest edition commencing in August 2017. Check out more about the pianos here. Play It Forward Singapore was commended by the Ministry of Culture, Community, Youth and Sports (MCCY) “Our Singapore” campaign as one of the “ideas that are changing Singapore” in 2016.We cannot wait to do more and bring together more people in this movement of giving, collaborating and sharing the joy of music in our lion city.",,https://playitforwardsg.org/,,,"Family Services , Items Assistance",,,sg.playitforward@gmail.com,,

Medical Care,TWC2,"In a typical year, the largest of our Care Fund programmes goes to providing medical care. Whilst the law obliges employers to purchase insurance and thereby provide medical care, the law also sets out maximum limits to this obligation. There is a cap on how much medical costs need be borne by employers for injuries or illnesses. The cap is not unrealistic — in the main, almost all cases would not require more medical care than permitted by the cap.Invariably however, there will be outliers. These would be workers who have suffered such severe injures, necessitating major brain surgery or reconstructive surgery, for example, that costs far exceed the amount employers are obliged to pay for. From time to time too, workers come down with illnesses that may require long stays in hospitals or complex treatment, again beyond the legal cap.Some employers go well beyond their legal obligation, picking up the tab for extra medical care. Others do not. And that’s where TWC2 has to come in, on a humanitarian basis to ensure that the ill or injured worker does not see his treatment truncated and his suffering prolonged.TWC2 weighs each case very carefully. High priority is given to cases where surgery or medical treatment has a high chance of restoring the patient to an active working life so that he or she can continue to be a breadwinner.

Project Roof,TWC2,"Under the law, employers are required to continue to house their former employees till their cases are concluded and they go home or they have found a new job. In reality, workers — in the hundreds and maybe thousands — find it impossible to stay on in company quarters. They report a climate of intimidation and constant fear that the company would send in strong-armed repatriation agents in the middle of the night, seizing them and bundling them off to the airport against their will. These fears are not unfounded. TWC2 has heard many first-hand reports of such repatriation tactics. In any event, it is entirely conceivable that some companies may try all means to avoid the cost of housing their workers by making it difficult for them to stay on.Workers who flee company accommodation may borrow money from friends and relatives to rent a bunk space. But there are some with neither willing friends or relatives in Singapore.Project Roof helps subsidise their rent. The men find their own accommodation — typically a bunk in a crowded tenement in Little India — and, subject to eligibility criteria and financial limits set out in our programme, we help pay for it.It goes without saying that there are far more workers in need of such assistance than we can provide. Consequently, we apply strict criteria, chief of which is the severity of a worker’s &nbsp;injury.

The Cuff Road Project,TWC2,"TWC2’s free meals programme is called The Cuff Road Project. Begun in March 2008, it is the largest of TWC2’s direct services. (Other programmes are described in the section [Care Fund Programmes](http://twc2.sg/what-we-do/care-fund-programmes/).)Based in Little India, The Cuff Road Project offers a free breakfast and an ample dinner every weekday. On Saturday, the meal provided is lunch. Our eligibility criteria are straightforward: clients should be documented migrant workers who are out of a job.Why is there a need? Migrant workers who are in dispute with their employers, or are injured, have no family here to fall back on. Although the law requires employers to provide “upkeep and maintenance”, which in practice may be understood to mean accommodation and food, the reality is that when the relationship has turned acrimonious, employers may not fulfill their obligations willingly. Workers report facing enormous pressure to leave their dormitories. They also fear that continuing to stay in company housing exposes them to the risk of forcible repatriation before they’ve received their due salaries or injury compensation. Many workers thus leave or are forced out of dormitories.They may have to borrow from friends to pay the monthly rent for a bunk. This leaves them with no margin to pay for adequate food. Especially when they are already injured, poor nutrition may retard their recovery.TWC2’s Cuff Road Project thus makes an important difference.*On average, we serve 400 – 500&nbsp; workers a day.*TWC2’s volunteers are stationed at the food point so that workers have someone to talk to and consult. We give advice on what rights and options they may have, and how they can pursue their cases. Our volunteers also monitor their progress.The statistics that we compile from the cases we see at the Cuff Road Food Programme give us an overall picture of the kinds of difficulties and the scale of exploitation and abuse workers suffer.

Wednesday Clinic,TWC2,"In Singapore, dispute resolution avenues for injury or salary claims are typified by a two- or three-stage process.For injury cases, the first stage comprises administrative processes under the Ministry of Manpower, keeping costs low for the claimant workers. Should one party disagree with the outcome of this stage, an appeal can be made to the courts — this would be the second stage.For salary cases, the first stage involves mediation organised by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM). If this proves fruitless, the case moves on to the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) for adjudication. No legal representation is allowed at either TADM or the ECT.These initial stages in both injury and salary cases may not require much in terms of financial outlay by claimant workers, though extensive casework support is often needed. Our Wednesday Clinic team provides this intensive support, helping migrant workers overcome educational, language or evidentiary disadvantages during these administrative stages. For example, many are unable to calculate exactly how much they are owed, or how to tease out arguments from whatever documents they have.It is when a case goes beyond the administrative stages to the High Court, in the form of appeals, that costs kick in. Most cases don’t get this far, but when they do, the financial weakness of migrant workers becomes a barrier to accessing justice. They need legal representation and there are all sorts of costs to be borne, e.g. filing fees, production or extraction of documents, forensic reports, fees for expert witnesses, etc.",,https://twc2.org.sg/what-we-do/care-fund-programmes/,,,"Others , Migrant Workers",,6247 7001,info@twc2.org.sg,180B Bencoolen Street #09-01\nThe Bencoolen,

Blood Donation and Bone Marrow Registry,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"<h3>Blood Donation</h3>In 2003, the severe outbreak of SARS led to a global epidemic where even Singapore, with its advanced healthcare services, was not spared. The epidemic caused widespread fear among the masses, with many people avoiding crowded places. As a result, the blood bank at the Health Sciences Authority faced a severe shortage in blood supply. In response to this crisis, the Singapore Red Cross made an open appeal to many organisations for partnerships in blood donation drives to make it easier for members of the public to donate blood and at the same time drive home the importance of blood donation.Tzu Chi Singapore contacted the Red Cross and decided to jointly hold a blood donation drive with the society. Since their first partnership in June 2003, blood donation drives have been an important part of Tzu Chi’s activities. Presently, other than holding quarterly blood donation drives in Jing Si Hall and Westgate, Tzu Chi has also created weekday blood donation points for the convenience of busy working folks. These blood donation points are situated in the heartlands, such as Tampines, Toa Payoh, Senja Cashew, Yishun East, etc., enabling residents to donate blood conveniently within their neighbourhoods.The blood bank would further separate the donated blood supplies into blood plasma, platelets and red blood cells, enabling them to be used to save the lives of patients with different blood conditions. Hence, during a blood donation drive, Tzu Chi volunteers would appeal to the public through the use of information boards to donate blood with the slogan, “A bag of blood can save three lives”. They would station themselves in crowded places, such as outside MRT stations, markets, shopping malls, etc. to promote the activity and also provide transport for donors to and from the donation point.The blood donation process, which includes welcoming potential donors at the entrance and providing care and support before and after donation, is carefully planned and implemented to facilitate the steps involved. Caring and helpful Tzu Chi volunteers keep the donors company throughout the entire process, and their warm hospitality is a boost to the confidence of first-time donors.The Foundation has been commended for its tireless efforts in helping to save lives and has received many accolades as an active organiser of blood donation drives. For several consecutive years, it has received the Blood Mobile Organiser Gold Award. As of 2021, it has collected more than 29,500 units of blood.[Donor criteria](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/blood-donation/can-i-donate)&nbsp;&nbsp;[Donate blood](https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/events/)<h3>Bone Marrow Donor Drive</h3>“Bone Marrow Donation” is one of the “Eight Footprints” of Tzu Chi Taiwan. In the early days, the Singapore public’s knowledge of bone marrow donation was rather limited. It was only after the establishment of the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (BMDP) in 1993 that Tzu Chi Singapore began working with the former to hold public talks on bone marrow donation and to organise bone marrow donor drives. Tzu Chi and the BMDP jointly advocated the importance of bone marrow donation in saving lives and even held fundraisers to support the expensive bone marrow tests. In 2003, the two organisations collaborated for the first time to conduct a bone marrow donor drive during a Tzu Chi blood donation drive. &nbsp;From 1994 to 2007, Tzu Chi added nearly 2,600 records to BMDP’s database. Tzu Chi and BMDP resumed their cooperation in October 2022 to simultaneously register bone marrow donors during blood donation drives, giving local patients with blood disorders the hope of life with bone marrow matching.",,https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/en/our-missions/medicine/blood-donation-and-bone-marrow-registry/,,,"Health and Medical , Others (Health and Medical)",,6582 9958,info@tzuchi.org.sg,,

Day Rehabilitation Centre,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"As Singapore faces the challenges of a rapidly aging population, there is a significant rise in the number of sufferers of chronic diseases and physical or cognitive decline. Over the two years of implementing home healthcare services in the western region of Singapore, Tzu Chi has discovered that in fact, the conditions of many of these patients could have been improved or prevented from worsening through physical therapy.Since after Tzu Chi took over the operations of Lakeside Family Medicine Clinic in November 2016, the GP outpatient services formerly provided by the Tzu Chi Free Health Screening and Medical Clinic were relocated to the Family Medicine Clinic. With the approval of the Ministry of Health, the vacated space that was previously taken up by the Free Health Screening and Medical Clinic was refurbished into the Tzu Chi Day Rehabilitation Centre, to better serve the needs of an aging population. The Centre is replete with two consultation rooms, a rehabilitation room, an electroconvulsive therapy room, an occupational therapy room, and a neurological rehabilitation room.Stroke survivors, sufferers of Parkinson’s disease and those having chronic pain in the neck, back and/or knees are the most common patients at the Day Rehabilitation Centre, and a significant number of them are senior citizens. The long and slow process of rehabilitation not only requires physiotherapy, but the mindset of the patients towards recovery plays an important role, too.

Families undergo emotional distress with the transitory loss of a loved one. Following the incarceration, families are often coerced to take on multiple roles and responsibilities, especially when the incarcerated member used to play an active role in the household. As a result, families are thrusted into challenging situations, such as financial difficulties caused by the cessation of a regular income and issues pertaining to childcare, healthcare, eldercare and parenting.For the incarcerated, their release from prison can be a challenging process as well. Estranged relationships with family members due to his/her incarceration may affect the support that is most needed upon their release. As they prepare to reintegrate into the community, inmates often face a lack in fundamental needs (e.g. finances, employment, accommodation, medical and mental health needs). More often than not, these are paramount in mitigating risks of recidivism in the future.",,https://fycs.org/inmates-and-their-families/,,,"Family Services , Prison Support Services",,6546 7460,,"Prison Link Centre, Changi\n990 Upper Changi Road North\nLevel 2",

During this programme, which includes Family Joint Visits, mothers and fathers share messages of encouragement and love through writing short stories to their children.They also record themselves reading the stories so that their children can listen to the voices of their mothers and fathers even while separated by prison walls.<h4>Family Care</h4>Guided by the Systemic Practice approach, we focus on the whole family system rather than the individual, ensuring that the whole family is involved in the reintegration of the ex-offender.

肌肉萎缩症指的是导致患者肌肉无力、衰退和挛缩的一组疾病的统称。这些疾病通常会逐步恶化，有些甚至危及生命。疾病是由异常基因所引发。
While most of these disorders manifest in childhood, some may have an adult onset. The severity of the symptoms, the age at which the symptoms appear, how fast the individual deteriorates, and the pattern of inheritance the disorder follows, vary from one form of Muscular Dystrophy to another.
大部分病症在患者年幼时出现，有的可能在成年时发病。肌肉萎缩症的症状严重度、几岁出现症状、情况对快恶化，以及遗传基因的途径，取决于肌肉萎缩症的类别。
Over time, persons with Muscular Dystrophy may lose the ability to walk, and ultimately breathe. For some individuals, the disorder is life-threatening. At present, there is no known cure for Muscular Dystrophy.

Society for Continence Singapore,Society for Continence Singapore,"Origins
The Society for Continence (Singapore) (SFCS) originated from the dedicated efforts of a group of doctors, nurses and rehabilitation therapists who recognised the special needs of the incontinent as far back as 1988. Among the pioneering group of people to be mentioned are Dr Anne Merriman, Dr Rilly Ray and Prof Peter Lim Huat Chye. In 1988, a symposium on the Management of Urinary Incontinence was held for the first time in Singapore for all healthcare professionals to address this growing malady.
The enthusiasm shown by medical professionals in treating incontinent patients prompted Prof Peter Lim Huat Chye, a Consultant Urologist to form an organisation to look into this sub-specialty. SFCS was officially set up in Toa Payoh Hospital as a voluntary welfare organisation registered with the Singapore government in 1991.
Objectives

- to disseminate information and educate healthcare professionals and the public on methods to promote urinary &amp; bowel continencen
- to promote the education, training and rehabilitation of the incontinent and their general interests and welfaren
- to do such things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects, the Society may:n

Therapy Services,Club Rainbow,"**1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CORE THERAPY SERVICES**Club Rainbow provides various therapy services to meet the needs of our beneficiaries. To register your child, please click: [Therapy Referral Form](https://www.clubrainbow.org/s/Core-Therapy-Referral-Form.pdf)Let us speak to some therapists to understand more about the services.**1.1 &nbsp; Physiotherapy**My clients in Club Rainbow have a variety of conditions ranging from Cerebral Palsy to Muscular Dystrophy to genetic or chromosomal syndromes, all of which contribute to some form of movement impairment and/or delay in their gross motor skills. After an assessment to identify such movement impairments and/or the aspects of gross motor skills in which the child is delayed in, I will set functional goals with the caregivers and the child (where able), in order to optimize the child’s functional mobility in the most efficient way possible.Interventions will then be focused on the promotion of mobility and achieving age appropriate gross motor skills (eg. Crawling, walking, running, jumping) through fun games and activities that incorporate training for strength, balance, coordination, flexibility and endurance, depending on the child’s needs. Also, intervention would incorporate management of the secondary issues that the child may present with, such as coping strategies for scoliosis, hip subluxations/dislocations, optimizing respiratory function and infection control.As majority of my clients are seen at the comfort of their own home, I modify the home exercise programmes according to what the clients have available at home; whether it is to use stools or the sofa, or even the neighbourhood playground/environment. I also teach caregivers handling skills and strategies for positioning for improved posture and comfort, especially for children who suffer from scoliosis arising from their condition. It is important for me to ensure that caregivers are comfortable in conducting the exercises on their own without compromising their own posture and comfort.Ultimately, the aim of physiotherapy is to maximize your child's quality of life by working with their caregivers to empower the child and increase their independent mobility to their fullest potential. With that in mind, here are a few physiotherapy tips and strategies that caregivers can adopt:1) Let your child do it!More often than not, we tend to perform as many daily tasks as we can for our children. Daily tasks that we normally find easy such as putting on shoes and socks, feeding oneself, opening a bottle and so on, may be more difficult and time consuming for our children to perform, hence we tend to do it for them. However, it is so important for us to remember to include them in performing such tasks! Getting them to participate with varying degrees of assistance (from independent to hand over hand assistance) can increase your child's confidence and improve their self-esteem. It may be more time consuming, but imagine the joy and satisfaction they feel when you praise them for even trying to participate.2) Have a stretching routine and stick to it!If your child does not have a home stretching exercise programme yet, do ensure that you speak to a physiotherapist to obtain one. It is crucial for our children, especially those who are immobile, to have a stretching routine incorporated into their daily routine, whether it is passive or active. As children grow, their bones may grow faster than their muscles, especially in the case of children with physical disabilities due to the lack of usage of certain muscles. As such, muscles can become tight if not stretched out manually often enough, which may then contribute to further movement impairments and difficulties for the caregivers to shower or change diapers for the child, for example. Over time, tight muscles can become contractures and possibly lead to other complications such as hip dislocations, which may then lead to the need for other interventions such as surgery. Hence, by dedicating some time daily to perform a stretching routine for your child, you will reduce the chance or slow down the likelihood of the above from happening.3) Choose your toys wisely!When choosing toys for your child, cause and effect toys and toys that require movement from your child are the best. Cause and effect toys would be toys that require your child to for example push a button in order for the toy to play music, or light up etc. Such toys are helpful in the development of hand eye coordination, sensory exploration and can motivate them to move. Other toys such as blocks, ring stackers, puzzles and Lego can also be used as part of an obstacle course where they have to bring the toys from the start to the finish in order to complete the course. Remember to avoid toys that lets your child sit for long hours without any movement.And lastly, always remember that your child is a child first, before a child with special needs. (:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Physiotherapist*&nbsp;**1.2 Speech Therapy**In Club Rainbow, I see clients with a variety of speech and language difficulties that may or may not have resulted from their underlying diagnoses such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Global Developmental Delay and Muscular Dystrophy. These clients first undergo an assessment to identify areas in which they are either not developing at the same level as children their age are, or have significant difficulties that impact their functioning in daily life.Subsequently, these clients attend therapy sessions to work on goals targeted to their varying needs. Some of these goals include:-&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the child’s understanding and use of different words (e.g. nouns, verbs)-&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the length and type of sentences the child can produce-&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the child’s understanding of concepts (e.g. same/different, location)-&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the child’s functional communication, including using a picture communication system or selected words to communicate using speech or sign-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping the child speak more clearlyThere are several ways in which you can support your child’s language and speech development. Here are some suggested strategies that you can adopt:***Be interested in your child’s interests***Your child will be most motivated to communicate on items, activities or events that capture their interest. Observe your child to see what they show interest in and how they react to it. They may react using sounds, words, gestures or facial expressions. You can respond by **imitating** them, **interpreting** what they are trying to say or **commenting** on what they show interest in. Your child will know that you are interested in what they are seeing and doing, and be more motivated to communicate with you.***Create communication opportunities for your child***You may also engineer opportunities for your child to motivate them to interact and communicate. This involves creating situations in their environment in which they would be motivated to initiate communication. Such situations include:-&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing an item that the child likes within sight, but out of reach-&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing toys that are hard to operate, or within a tightly closed box-&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing something unexpected (e.g. passing your child something different from what they need)-&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer an item in parts (e.g. giving your child juice a little at a time)-&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer your child choices by presenting them with a few items-&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait and see what your child will do when they need help-&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop during a routine or song and observe how your child reactsYour child may respond to these situations through a variety of non-verbal communication modes (e.g. look at you, make sounds, reach out to an item, or appear excited). You can respond by interpreting their actions and expressions and giving them what they want (e.g. “Do you want the juice? Here you go.”***Book reading***Read books with your child and talk through them.&nbsp; You can ask them-&nbsp;&nbsp;What they think the story could be about (just by looking at the front cover and title)-&nbsp;&nbsp;What they think might happen next in the story-&nbsp;&nbsp;To think of another way the story could have ended-&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell you how the characters in the story feel and why-&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the story again (without looking at the book) to their siblings***Use of total communication (gestures, pictures, body language)***Your child may have difficulty understanding and using spoken language due to their underlying condition. When speaking to your child, you are encouraged to support your communication with gestures (e.g.&nbsp; pointing to objects, key word sign), pictures (e.g. books), and body language (e.g. facial expression, body posture). Your child will have a better understanding of your message when you deliver it both verbally and non-verbally. They may also adopt these means of non-verbal communication to enhance the clarity of their communication.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Speech Therapist*&nbsp;**1.3 &nbsp; Occupational Therapy**In Club Rainbow, a wide range of clients from different age groups and medical diagnosis attend occupational therapy sessions, usually referred by doctors from NUH and KKH. Based on the initial screening of clients and parents’ interview, clients are shortlisted for therapy, which is on a weekly basis. Goals based on parents’ priorities are set, followed by a review when the therapy cycle ends after five months. There are two intakes of clients scheduled in a year.&nbsp; Any recommendation of additional therapy cycles by therapist is purely based on client’s performance and needs.&nbsp;Session plans are based on individual client’s need and on the projected goals. Goals are functional and to maximize the client’s potential to help them gain independent, for instance, able to button or unbutton, eat finger foods, open water bottles cap and drink water, catch a ball, hold a writing device and scribble, colour, draw or write, putting in and take off socks and shoes, turn pages of a book, walk in the neighbourhood, maneuver motorized wheelchair, etc.&nbsp;Understanding the importance of caregivers’ role in clients’ lives, strategies are shared with caregivers so they can help clients to practice the activities and create more opportunities to repeat the activities at home. Caregivers are also encouraged to attend sharing session conducted by therapist during term-break. It was observed that active engagement of caregivers helps clients to improve the skills faster and achieve individualized goals set by therapist.In the centre, clients look forward for the occupational therapy session. They have fun while performing fine and gross motor activities in the gym and/or neighbourhood playground. It was observed that when clients have fun in participating in activities, they learn the skills faster. The activities were planned with just-right amount of challenges so that clients were able to complete the activity at end of the session. This improves their self-esteem and motivates them to try similar activities without any hesitation.&nbsp;In summary, as an occupational therapist, I help clients to perform their occupation with the fullest potential, for instance, play, activity of daily living (ADL), fine and gross motor skills that required to perform typical tasks they supposed to do routinely across the settings including home, community and in school. In addition, accessibility training for wheel chair bound clients inside home and in the community to make them more independent in their mobility. Even providing training for taking public transport is a part of my job to make them independent so that they are able to moving around freely in their own community.&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Senior Occupational Therapist*&nbsp;**2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY SERVICES****2.1 &nbsp; Art Therapy**Art Therapy is…A way to express thoughts, feelings and emotions without words.A way to explore materials and find ways to cope with complex emotions.A way to build self-awareness and self-esteemAbout enjoying the pleasure of creating in a safe and understanding environmentArt therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its primary mode of expression and communication. Within this context, art is not used as a diagnostic tool but as a medium to address emotional issues which may be confusing and distressing.Art therapists work with children, young people, adults and the elderly. Clients may have a wide range of difficulties, disabilities or diagnoses. These include emotional, behavioural or mental health problems, learning or physical disabilities, life-limiting conditions, neurological conditions and physical illnesses.Art therapy is provided in groups or individually, depending on clients' needs. It is not a recreational activity or an art lesson, although the sessions can be enjoyable. Clients do not need to have any previous experience or expertise in art.Art Therapy is being offered at Club Rainbow in collaboration with LASALLE College of the Arts and the MA Art Therapy Programme.&nbsp;**2.2 Play Therapy**Play therapy is a form of therapy primarily geared toward children. In this form of therapy, a therapist encourages a child to explore life events that may have an effect on current circumstances, in a manner and pace of the child's choosing, primarily through play but also through language.Play therapy, can help individuals communicate, explore repressed thoughts and emotions, address unresolved trauma, and experience personal growth and is widely viewed as an important, effective, and developmentally appropriate mental health treatment.TOYS ARE A CHILD’S WORDS!",,https://www.clubrainbow.org/therapy-services,,,"Health and Medical , Support for Health Conditions",,6377 1789,contact@clubrainbow.org,Blk 538 Upper Cross Street\n#05-263/269,"To register your child, please click: [Therapy Referral Form](https://www.clubrainbow.org/s/Core-Therapy-Referral-Form.pdf)"

Before the advent of COVID-19 in Singapore, we organised our monthly disbursement exercises by having about 20 – 30 kidney patients in attendance with their family members in conjunction with our monthly memorial prayers. We also seize the opportunity to invite a Community Figure/ Religious Leader to give a motivational talk to our patients.n- For our **Walk-In Assistance Scheme**, it allows MKAC to disburse cash assistance to patients as well as welcome new patients or non-kidney patients in registering with MKAC as one of our beneficiaries. We speak to our walk-in patients 1-on-1 to understand their situation more intimately and address their specific needs. Often times, the patients &amp; caregivers share their personal stories, and become emotional as they go about in juggling their daily responsibilities. Here, we at MKAC are always keen to listen on our patients’ concerns and worries and to help them with their financial situation.n- **Free Health Consultation**\nOn a monthly basis, our partner from Sunlove Free Clinic visits our MKAC HQ normally on the first Thursday of the month to provide Free Doctor Consultation &amp; Free Medicine. The medical checks are conducted by a volunteer doctor and nurses which they will always remind our patients on how to stay healthy and keep fit with their condition. Where patients are in crisis and need further medical treatment, MKAC offers financial assistance on a case-by-case basis to enable them to continue their dialysis treatment and purchase of medication. MKAC established this scheme so that kidney patients do not have to worry about receiving medical treatment due to financial constraints.nMKAC intends this scheme to be a stopgap measure between the onset of kidney failure and alternative sustainable solutions. As such, the search for sustainable sources of income/ assistance is an integral part of the patient’s follow up in this scheme.",,https://www.mkac.sg/care-compassion/,,,"Financial Aid and Food Aid , Financial Aid , Cash Assistance",,6440 7390,info@mkac.sg,122 Telok Kurau Rd,

Free Dental Services,Tzu-Chi Foundation,"With the support of former Health Minister Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Tzu Chi Free Clinic was established on 1st August 2004 in Chinatown, marking a historic milestone for the Medical Mission of Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu-Chi Foundation (Singapore). It primarily served low-income households and elderly residents living in the vicinity and also the Foundation’s long-term aid beneficiaries. With the return of the Foundation’s former premises in Chinatown to its owner in 2007, the clinic temporarily ceased operations.Through the support and assistance of the Ministry of Health, MP for the Tanjong Pagar GRC Mr Tan Chin Siong, and the Radin Mas grassroots organisation, the clinic found a new home in Redhill in 2008. Occupying an area of nearly 5,000 square feet, the spacious and well-equipped modern clinic is replete with consultation rooms, dental treatment rooms, health examination rooms, a mini operating theatre, an X-ray room, and a meeting room.After its relocation, Tzu Chi Free Clinic (Singapore) resumed operations on 1st November 2008. It provides free General Medicine, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and dental services mainly to seniors living alone, low-income households, Tzu Chi’s aid beneficiaries as well as migrant workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Free Clinic adhered to safety measures to protect the health of vulnerable groups while providing medical and dental treatments to more than 1,200 patients in the two years. &nbsp;The dental team has also been carrying out the CASA-MODAL dental project since 2018 to make up for the demand for dental services by underprivileged groups. The dental team regularly visits institutions such as homes for the mentally handicapped, nursing homes and other institutions to provide on-site dental services. As of the end of March 2022, this project has benefited 12 nursing homes and more than 810 nursing home residents. In addition to that, the dental team also arranged for patients with special needs to receive dental treatment at the Free Clinic upon the easing of the pandemic situation.

We wanted to apply our common love for breaking to serving a greater cause. Our central idea was simple: breaking had empowered us, and can similarly empower others.Troubled and disaffected youths often benefit from having an anchor in their formative years to channel their energies productively. This led us to explore breaking as a way to reach out to youth communities.

Kid's Weekday Care - YWCA,Kid's Weekday Care - YWCA,"Supporting Underprivileged Children
Replacing the former Kids’ Club programme which ran from 2007 to 2015, the YWCA Kids’ Weekday Care (KWC) programme was set up in 2016 to provide afterschool care to latch-key children from low-income families. It was created in response to demand for afterschool care needs from our beneficiary families under our Meals-on-Wheels (https://ywca.org.sg/food-distribution/meals-on-wheels/) programme.
The thrice-weekly afterschool care service covers two-way transport from school and back to their respective homes, halal lunch and a structured care schedule at a highly subsidised cost.
The care programme aims to provide social, emotional, moral and academic support to disadvantaged children by creating a rewarding and conducive environment for them to develop their self-worth and character, discover their unique potential, and strive for excellence. In doing so, it perpetuates YWCA’s endeavours to offer a more holistic approach to helping children from low-income families under the Meals-on-Wheels programme and those who are referred by schools.
The Kids’ Weekday Care focuses on the overall development of children through a broad range of activities such as tutoring, mentorship, enrichment, soft skills and life skills workshops, outings and group work. Service and value-based learning is emphasized, as well as work in alliance with parents. Casework and counselling will be available for children who require it.
The service runs every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2pm to 6pm at the YWCA Kids’ Weekday Care room at Outram. The centre will be closed at 6.30pm and on school and public holidays.",,https://ywca.org.sg/community-support/kids-weekday-care/,,,"Children and Youth , Education and Guidance , Tutoring | Children and Youth , Education and Guidance , Mentoring | Children and Youth , Education and Guidance , Enrichment Programmes",,6223 1227,csp@ywca.org.sg,254 Outram Road,"Contact your nearest Family Service Centre/Social Service Centre to request for a social worker who will apply on your behalf.

The #Engage Initiative,TRCL,"n## The #Engage Initiative\nMore than ever, the recent Covid-19 public health crisis in 2020 highlighted the social impact of the “digital divide.”&nbsp;Through a collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MOE) during the Circuit Breaker period in May-June 2020, our #Engage initiative provided online engagement programmes for vulnerable children and youths within the safe environment of their schools. TRCL noted three gaps in society: a lack of access to digital devices among certain groups; a lack of digital literacy; a need for wholesome and original creative content.With Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions in mid-2021, we launched #Engage 3.0, which saw us partnering with Zhenghua community to provide much needed positive distraction for primary school children in the Bukit Panjang area. The strict curbs on outdoor activity meant that children had to stay indoors throughout the June school holidays. More than 300 surprise craft packs and tasty packed lunches were delivered twice a week for four weeks to five student care centres in primary schools. These craft packs with do-it-yourself craft projects were a source of entertainment and helped engage the under-12s in creative activities during the four-week school holiday.Called* #Engage 1 &amp; 2*, this collaboration which saw the launch of a new online arts festival platform where students could showcase both visual and performing arts work to the wide community also highlighted how such programmes impart new skills, build positive values and confidence and provide a wholesome experience for children with vulnerable background.The necessity of such initiatives was recently highlighted by President Halimah Yacob during the announcement of 2020’s President’s Challenge which is themed on building a digitally inclusive society. President Halimah noted that it was important for “social service agencies to really look at ways of giving access to our vulnerable communities, to the digital tools, to skills, to connectivity” as this was the only such communities could help remain economically and socially active.To date plans articulated – such as those by MOE to provide digital devices to students – do not extend to vulnerable children from primary schools.In this, *#Engage *by TRCL aims to build a digitally inclusive society through:- Providing digital devices for vulnerable childrenn- Developing original arts and culture programmes which engender creativity, inspire the acquisition of new skills and impart wholesome valuesn- Developing an annual online arts festival platform which showcases the creativity and voices of children and youth to the community.nWith *#Engage*, children from vulnerable communities will be able to have:- their own access to digital devicesn- free access&nbsp; to programme which will allow them to (a) be familiar with operating hardware and software and basic&nbsp; (b) develop digital content (c) acquire future skills eg AR/VR coding, online production, editing and creative skillsn*#Engage *aims to reach out to 300 children annually.",,https://trcl.sg/community-initiatives/,,,"Family Services , Items Assistance , IT Equipment | Children and Youth , Education and Guidance , Enrichment Programmes",,,,,

Community Shop 善粮小铺,Food From The Heart,"The Community Shop (善粮小铺) is a giving better initiative by Food from the Heart for its beneficiaries in Singapore. The Community Shop functions as a mini-mart for beneficiaries and operates on a shop-for-free concept.Food from the Heart's beneficiaries are empowered to choose 14 food items from the Community Shop each month, and can visit the Shop on multiple occasions throughout the month. Food items include fresh local produce, staples, canned food, bread spreads, biscuits, oil and condiments, all of which will allow beneficiaries to eat better.The food items are redeemed through the beneficiaries' cards via a QR code-scanning checkout system.The Community Shop is one of Food from the Heart's milestone initiatives that strives to give better by returning the dignity of choice to the needy; at the Shop, they are able to choose food items that they require instead of receiving standard food packages. This mental aspect helps to close the increasing gap in Singapore's standards of living; the experience of shopping allows them to see the range of products available at the Shop, compare them, and choose what they want to bring home.The Shop gives the beneficiaries a reason to get out of their homes to have more interaction with others, creating opportunities for the community to look out for one another. Its food drop, which allows donors to drop off food donations at the Shop, also helps to keep the kampung spirit alive within the neighbourhood.The Community Shop concept also results in less food waste as the beneficiaries are likely to finish all the items they chose themselves.Through the QR code-scanning checkout system, Food from the Heart is able to digitally gather data on the consumption, needs and patterns of its beneficiaries. With such insights, a more meaningful and nuanced understanding of beneficiaries' dietary habits will also help us shape the future landscape in food distribution efforts. We hope to create an entire eco-system connecting donors, sponsors, volunteers and beneficiaries.",,https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg/community-shop/,,,"Financial Aid and Food Aid , Food Aid , Food Rations",,,info@foodheart.org,Blk 176 Boon Lay Drive #01-366,
