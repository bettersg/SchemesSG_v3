It is a micro initiative with a big goal of spurring Singaporeans on to normalise and practice hospitality by befriending a stranger and letting them in.The issue of homelessness is a prevailing yet well-hidden problem in Singapore. It goes beyond the physical need of having a roof over one's head to the compromising safety and well-being of the individual.3 main categories of homelessness include:- People who sleep in public spaces due to a lack of permanent housing and accommodationn- People who reside in shelters and hostels due to housing eviction, etcn- People who live in overcrowded houses, who face family violence, or lack social support.nIf untaken care of, the issue of homelessness could hinder an individuals' sense of identity, security and belonging, impairing their physical and mental health.When the community comes together to support someone in crisis, we are able to provide and care for those in need in a more holistic and sustainable manner.To build a network of care and support around such Persons-in-crisis (PICs). We envisioned a re-energized ‘kampung spirit’ - neighbourliness in action, where resources get pooled together to help the needy in an organic manner. To do so, we came up with a framework consisting of host families, community representatives, case managers, social workers and our beneficiaries - the PICs. We created an Open Home Toolkit to equip host families to better engage and care for themselves during their time hosting.

The emotional and psychological impact on the victim can vary significantly from person to person.Sexual violence and assault are never the victim’s fault, and coping with life after the incident can be challenging.- Whether the incident happened years ago or yesterday, we can offer several ways to cope with the emotional and psychological effects of the sexual violence and assaultn- We will work with you to manage your feelings and learn new coping skills to minimise the negative impactnHealing</h6>Healing from sexual assault is usually a gradual and ongoing process that is often not linear or smooth. The healing process can sometimes even feel painful. With healing, you can regain control over yourself, find yourself and learn how you want to live life again. Healing can look drastically different from person to person.- We will support victims to regain the ability to feel safe and to trust, to learn to heal, and move on in life at their own pacen- Some topics include working through grief and facilitate to establish a solid foundation of understanding, safety, stability and self-regulation skillsn- We will journey with the victim through the healing process by ensuring the victim has access to counselling and therapy servicesnLife after Sexual Assault</h6>It is common for victims to withdraw from social interactions, and to feel isolated and disconnected from others.

Acknowledge how difficult it is for someone to share details of the traumatic incident. Appreciate them for their trust and let them know that you believe them as it encourages them to trust others again. n- **Ask how you can support:** While your first instinct might be to offer advice to your loved one, it is important to let them make their own decisions and choices about what to do next. If this is the first time the victim has disclosed the information, it is likely that they may not know what support you may be able to provide. As such, it is important to ask how you can support.n- **Listen without judgement**: Sexual assault is never the victim’s fault. It is normal to have strong reactions such as anger, sadness or shock when someone you care shares an experience of sexual assualt. Note that sometimes such reactions can make the victim feel responsible, ashamed and discourage them from sharing further or seeking help. Listen without interrupting them and do not ask for details that they do not wish to disclose. n- **Respect their privacy &amp; decisions:** Justice means different things to different people. Attempting to seek ‘justice’ might not be in the victim’s best interest or meet their needs. n- **Encourage them to seek help: **We have professionals who can work with them to support them better. n- **Keep supporting:** Healing and recovery takes time, support them along the way.
