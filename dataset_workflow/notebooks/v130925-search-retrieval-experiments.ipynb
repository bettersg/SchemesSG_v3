At Care Corner Youth Services, we believe that stressful experiences can provide opportunities for learning and growth, contributing to adolescentsâ€™ wealth of resources and knowledge to take on challenges in their lives.By **collaborating with schools, parents and community partners** to identify areas of need, we deliver **customised preventive programmes** to equip students with the resources to fulfil their educational goals.One of our key programmes in Youth Services which supports coping capabilities is swiTCH-UP!, a school-based 3-year programme that uses creative mediums as a means of engagement.  Ways We Support Creative Mediums</h4>Through the use of creative mediums (e.g. woodworking, pottery), we employ an experiential and hands-on learning approach to explore topics on stress, coping, and self-perception. The use of creative mediums allows adolescents to:- Express their thoughts, feelings, and experiencesn- Explore and unpack stressful experiencesn- Pause and engage in personal time for reflectionnGroup Learning</h4>In a group setting, adolescents can forge supportive relationships and learn from one another. This supports them in:- Identifying sources of stressn- Discussing their personal responses to stressn- Exploring and redefining their perception of selfn- Experiencing support and encouragement from one anothernProfessional Development for Educators</h4>Educators play an important role in supporting adolescents in strengthening their coping capabilities. We equip them with necessary skills and knowledge through: - **Exchanging insights** on supporting adolescents facing stressful experiencesn- **Sharing resources, tools, and competencies** used to explore stressful experiences with adolescents n- **Co-facilitating sessions with youth workers** to support the process of learningn\n",

As a Protection Specialist Centre, Care Corner Project StART provides integrated services for individuals and families affected by the issues of family violence.**By promoting safe interactions** and **healthy relationships** between individuals, our aim is to cultivate a society free from family violence. Ways We Support Consultation &amp; Advice</h6>We provide confidential consultations in person and over the phone for information on family violence as well as different types of support and resources available. If you would like to speak to someone about family violence, call us at **6476 1482** (weekdays 10am â€“ 1pm, 2pm â€“ 5pm; except public holidays) or email us at [projectstart@carecorner.org.sg](mailto:projectstart@carecorner.org.sg).Should you be in immediate danger, call the police (999) or go to your nearest neighbourhood police station. Alternatively, you may call the 24-hr National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (NAVH) at 1800-777-0000.Counselling &amp; Case Management</h6>We provide counselling, practical and emotional support to victims, individuals using violence and vulnerable family members who witnessed the abuse (e.g., children and the elderly).With the goal of mitigating the impact of family violence and increasing safety in the home, our team of social work practitioners work closely with individuals and families who experience violence at home.Group Work </h6>We conduct group work sessions to provide a safe platform for victims with similar experiences of family violence to learn from, share with and support each other. The sessions aim to reduce the barriers of shame, isolation and loneliness that are often experienced by those who have experienced family violence. You can draw comfort and encouragement from others in their respective journeys towards healing and restoration. Application of Personal Protection Order (PPO)</h6>A Personal Protection Order (PPO) is an order restraining one from committing family violence against another family member. We assist victims of family violence in their PPO application with the Family Justice Courts. To apply for a PPO, call us at **6476 1482 **(weekdays 10am â€“ 1pm, 2pm â€“ 5pm; except public holidays) or head down to the Family Justice Courts.
